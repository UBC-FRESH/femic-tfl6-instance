# Change Log

## 2026-06-23 - Bootstrapped the NICF FSP FRST 558 instance repository

- created the FEMIC instance scaffold for `femic-nicffsp-instance`;
- added modelwright-style workflow surfaces (`AGENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`,
  `CHANGE_LOG.md`, and `planning/`);
- tracked the initial NICF FSP AOI, LU, and FSP source payloads under lowercase
  repo-relative paths; and
- recorded the first build-plan boundary: source inspection and K3Z-template
  adaptation must happen before any Patchworks runtime success is claimed.

## 2026-06-23 - Split Phase 1 into task-wise GitHub issues

- narrowed `#1` to `P1.2` source-payload inspection and normalization;
- opened `#3` for the `P1.3` K3Z-to-NICF adaptation contract;
- opened `#2` for the `P1.4` cedar, expansion, and runtime-package follow-on
  issue split; and
- updated the roadmap so the active edge stays on `P1.2` source normalization
  before model design or compilation work starts.

## 2026-06-23 - Added the Phase 1 parent issue

- opened parent phase issue `#4` for Phase 1;
- linked child task issues `#1`, `#3`, and `#2` from the parent issue body;
- added child-issue backlinks to `#4`; and
- updated the roadmap so Phase 1 follows the modelwright parent/child issue
  workflow.

## 2026-06-23 - Hardened the agent issue-workflow contract

- amended `AGENTS.md` so future roadmap phase expansions must use one GitHub
  parent issue per phase and one linked child issue per phase task;
- documented the child backlink, issue-body checklist, closure, and PR/merge
  rules; and
- recorded that parallel phase lanes require explicit maintainer approval.

## 2026-06-23 - Inspected the NICF FSP amendment spatial payload

- inventoried `data/source/nicf_fsp/nicf_fsp_amendment_3_spatial.zip`;
- found one shapefile family, `NICF_FDU_2024`, with six valid EPSG:3005 polygon
  features labeled as FDU/LU records;
- recorded feature labels, CRS, bounds, geometry validity, and measured areas in
  `planning/source_inventory.md`; and
- kept the runtime AOI boundary undecided pending cross-check against the FSP
  document and separate LU boundary payload.

## 2026-06-23 - Inspected the BCGW landscape-unit clip payload

- inventoried `data/source/nicf_fsp/bcgw_lu_clip_2026_06.zip`;
- found one BCGW `RMP_LU_SVW_polygon` shapefile family with `27` valid EPSG:3005
  landscape-unit polygons;
- recorded LU names, CRS, bounds, validity, measured areas, and overlap with
  the `NICF_FDU_2024` AOI candidate in `planning/source_inventory.md`; and
- kept the relevant-LU decision open because the inspected spatial payloads show
  six FDU/LU overlaps, while the project note expected three relevant LUs.

## 2026-06-23 - Cross-checked the FSP PDF against the FDU/LU names

- extracted text from `data/source/nicf_fsp/nicf_forest_stewardship_plan_2020.pdf`;
- confirmed the 2020 FSP text identifies three proposed FDUs: Holberg, Keogh,
  and Marble;
- recorded that the additional 2024 amendment spatial names (`Nahwitti`,
  `Shushartie`, and `Tsulquate`) do not appear in the extracted 2020 FSP text;
  and
- kept the accepted runtime AOI undecided as a source-version choice between
  the 2020 FSP text and the 2024 amendment spatial payload.

## 2026-06-23 - Accepted the 2024 amendment FDU layer as bootstrap AOI source

- recorded `NICF_FDU_2024.shp` as the accepted bootstrap AOI source because the
  project request identifies the amendment spatial payload as the new AOI;
- preserved six FDU/LU features as canonical source semantics rather than
  treating a dissolved AOI polygon as source truth;
- kept the 2020 FSP three-FDU evidence as historical/context evidence; and
- left canonical extraction and runtime config wiring for a later bounded
  `P1.2` slice.

## 2026-06-23 - Extracted the canonical bootstrap AOI source layer

- extracted `NICF_FDU_2024` from the amendment zip into
  `data/source/nicf_fsp/aoi/nicf_fdu_2024.*`;
- verified the extracted shapefile reads as six valid EPSG:3005 polygon
  features with the same bounds and area recorded during raw-payload
  inspection;
- recorded file hashes and read-verification evidence in
  `planning/source_inventory.md`; and
- left BCGW LU canonical-reference and runtime config wiring decisions for
  later bounded `P1.2` slices.

## 2026-06-23 - Corrected the canonical FSP AOI to FDU 1-3 only

- corrected the bootstrap AOI convention after project clarification that only
  FDU 1 Holberg, FDU 2 Keogh, and FDU 3 Marble make up the FSP AOI;
- replaced the misleading six-feature canonical AOI extraction with
  `data/source/nicf_fsp/aoi/nicf_fsp_aoi.*`;
- verified the corrected canonical AOI reads as three valid EPSG:3005 polygon
  features with total measured area `147798.392 ha`; and
- kept the original amendment zip as raw provenance for all six amendment
  features.

## 2026-06-23 - Extracted the canonical LU reference context

- decided that the full 27-feature BCGW LU payload remains raw provenance while
  the canonical LU reference context is the FSP-relevant Holberg, Keogh, and
  Marble subset;
- extracted that subset to
  `data/source/nicf_fsp/lu_reference/nicf_lu_reference.*`;
- verified the LU reference layer reads as three valid EPSG:3005 polygon
  features with total measured area `165588.857 ha`; and
- marked `P1.2d` complete while leaving run-profile source-path wiring as the
  next bounded `P1.2` move.

## 2026-06-23 - Wired the NICF run profile to accepted source paths

- updated `config/run_profile.nicffsp.yaml` so `selection.boundary_path` points
  at `data/source/nicf_fsp/aoi/nicf_fsp_aoi.shp`;
- recorded the LU reference source at
  `selection.source_context.lu_reference_path` as
  `data/source/nicf_fsp/lu_reference/nicf_lu_reference.shp`;
- kept raw zip payloads out of runtime source-path wiring; and
- marked `P1.2` complete in the roadmap, leaving `P1.3` as the next active
  Phase 1 task.

## 2026-06-23 - Compared the K3Z template against the NICF scaffold

- recorded the `P1.3a` K3Z-to-NICF comparison in
  `planning/k3z_template_adaptation.md`;
- identified the K3Z surfaces that can provide structure but not accepted NICF
  semantics: run profile, rebuild spec, model-input bundle, treatment variants,
  Patchworks tracks, and runtime package layout;
- recorded that NICF does not yet have a model-input bundle or Patchworks
  package and that `config/patchworks.runtime.windows.yaml` remains a
  K3Z-shaped placeholder; and
- marked `P1.3a` complete while leaving run-profile boundary defaults and
  assumption review lists as the next `P1.3` moves.

## 2026-06-23 - Defined the first NICF run-profile boundary

- activated the first NICF stratification defaults in
  `config/run_profile.nicffsp.yaml`: subzone BEC grouping, two-species
  combinations, TM second-species fallback, and `0.90` area coverage;
- set first-compile runtime defaults to `resume: false`,
  `vdyp_sampling_mode: all`, `vdyp_two_pass_rebin: true`,
  `vdyp_min_stands_per_si_bin: 10`, and `managed_curve_mode: tipsy`;
- recorded the P1.3b decision in `planning/k3z_template_adaptation.md`; and
- marked `P1.3b` complete while keeping K3Z assumption review and minimum
  model-input surfaces as the next `P1.3` work.

## 2026-06-23 - Split K3Z carry-forward and review assumptions

- added the `P1.3c` carry-forward and FRST 558 review tables to
  `planning/k3z_template_adaptation.md`;
- accepted K3Z structure, run-profile mechanics, bundle table contracts, and
  package layout as structural carry-forward assumptions;
- marked K3Z TIPSY rules, treatment variants, cedar signals, expansion
  candidate rules, seral objectives, product/account targets, and baseline
  acceptance metrics as review-required before implementation; and
- marked `P1.3c` complete while leaving minimum source-derived model-input
  surfaces as the remaining `P1.3` planning move.

## 2026-06-23 - Accepted the first K3Z-to-NICF adaptation boundary

- recorded the minimum source-derived model-input surfaces required before
  Patchworks runtime-package work in `planning/k3z_template_adaptation.md`;
- defined the P1.4 handoff terms for cedar-signal, expansion-candidate, and
  runtime-package follow-on issue bodies;
- recorded P1.3 non-goals so no model-input bundle, K3Z tracks, cedar products,
  expansion logic, or runtime package work starts inside adaptation planning;
  and
- marked `P1.3` complete in the roadmap.

## 2026-06-23 - Queued 2025 VRI source-data collection for Phase 1

- opened `#5` as `P1.5` for materializing the latest 2025 provincial VRI R1
  and VDYP7 polygon/layer source packages before NICF base AOI inventory
  extraction depends on them;
- added `planning/vri_2025_data_collection.md` with package ids, expected
  source package names, public-data target paths, and acceptance criteria;
- updated the Phase 1 roadmap and parent issue so the new data-collection task
  is a linked child issue; and
- kept the task boundary to source materialization and verification, with no
  model-input bundle or Patchworks runtime-package build started.

## 2026-06-23 - Recorded 2025 VRI package metadata

- recorded the official BCDC titles, package ids, package UUIDs, resource ids,
  resource names, modified timestamps, formats, and direct package URLs for the
  2025 R1 and VDYP7 polygon/layer source packages in
  `planning/vri_2025_data_collection.md`;
- marked `P1.5a` complete in the roadmap; and
- kept package size, checksum, read-smoke, and public-data publication status
  open until the archives are actually materialized.

## 2026-06-23 - Materialized the 2025 VRI source archives

- downloaded the 2025 R1 and VDYP7 polygon/layer source archives into
  `external/femic-public-data/data/bc/vri/2025/`;
- validated both archives with a zip CRC pass before accepting them as
  materialized local sources;
- annex-added and pushed the public-data commit
  `348d9b60529e3a0160672048fc33e4083f2128fb`; and
- marked `P1.5b` complete while leaving geodatabase read-smoke, CRS, and
  public-remote publication evidence open.

## 2026-06-23 - Added the TFL 6 MP10 information-package reference

- found the BC-hosted copy of the TFL 6 Management Plan 10 timber supply
  analysis information package;
- downloaded it to
  `data/source/nicf_fsp/reference/tfl_6_management_plan_10_information_package_2011.pdf`;
- verified the PDF page count, checksum, and title text; and
- recorded source provenance in `planning/source_inventory.md`.

## 2026-06-23 - Queued the TFL 6 AOI pivot and TSR recipe lanes

- opened `#6` for the active AOI pivot to TFL 6 and the TFL 6-clipped 2025 VRI
  input-layer build;
- opened `#7` for translating the 2011 TFL 6 management plan and information
  package into FEMIC-style source-layer and THLB netdown recipe planning;
- added `planning/tfl6_aoi_pivot_and_input_layers.md` and
  `planning/tfl6_thlb_recipe_extraction.md`; and
- updated the roadmap so the original FDU 1/2/3 boundary remains provenance but
  is superseded for active model extraction.

## 2026-06-23 - Reconciled pre-pivot AOI planning surfaces

- updated the README, quickstart, run-profile comments, and older planning
  notes so TFL 6 is consistently described as the active target AOI;
- preserved the current `selection.boundary_path` value as a temporary
  pre-pivot bootstrap path until `P1.6a` materializes the TFL 6 boundary; and
- clarified that FDU 1/2/3 source layers remain valid provenance, not the active
  model extraction boundary.

## 2026-06-23 - Materialized the TFL 6 boundary

- fetched `WHSE_ADMIN_BOUNDARIES.FADM_TFL` where `FOREST_FILE_ID='TFL6'`;
- wrote the normalized boundary to
  `data/source/tfl_6/aoi/tfl_6_boundary.gpkg`;
- verified 182 EPSG:3005 features, `217042.719 ha` union area, matching bounds,
  and valid geometries after repairing one source ring self-intersection; and
- switched `config/run_profile.nicffsp.yaml` to the accepted TFL 6 boundary
  path and marked `P1.6a` complete.

## 2026-06-23 - Indexed the TFL 6 reference corpus

- added the locally copied TFL 6 reference corpus under `reference/`;
- generated `reference/tfl6_reference_index.json` and
  `reference/tfl6_reference_index.md`;
- extracted searchable text for all readable PDFs under
  `reference/extracted_text/`;
- indexed 18 files: 17 PDFs and one image, including AAC rationale, licence
  maps, instrument, annual reports, Management Plan 9/10 files, analysis report,
  and information package documents; and
- marked `P1.7a` complete.

## 2026-06-23 - Prepared the instance rename to femic-tfl6-instance

- updated visible instance naming in README, quickstart, AGENTS, roadmap, and
  generated corpus metadata ahead of the GitHub/local submodule rename.

## 2026-06-23 - Clipped the 2025 R1 VRI source to TFL 6

- read the provincial 2025 R1 polygon source from the FEMIC public-data mirror;
- bbox-filtered `42297` R1 features to the TFL 6 boundary extent;
- exact-clipped `26959` intersecting features to the dissolved TFL 6 boundary;
- wrote `data/input/tfl_6/vri_2025_r1_poly_tfl6.gpkg` and
  `data/input/tfl_6/vri_2025_r1_poly_tfl6_clip_manifest.json`;
- verified `26959` valid EPSG:3005 MultiPolygon features with
  `217042.718950 ha` clipped area; and
- identified `feature_id` as the preferred VDYP join-key candidate for `P1.6c`.

## 2026-06-23 - Filtered the 2025 VDYP7 tables to TFL 6

- filtered `VEG_COMP_VDYP7_INPUT_POLY` and `VEG_COMP_VDYP7_INPUT_LAYER` to the
  `26959` clipped TFL 6 R1 feature IDs;
- wrote `data/input/tfl_6/vdyp7_input_poly_2025_tfl6.parquet`,
  `data/input/tfl_6/vdyp7_input_layer_2025_tfl6.parquet`, and
  `data/input/tfl_6/vdyp7_input_2025_tfl6_filter_manifest.json`;
- retained `26833` VDYP7 polygon rows and `25585` VDYP7 layer rows;
- verified that retained VDYP7 polygon rows have no feature IDs outside the
  clipped R1 set and that retained VDYP7 layer rows have no feature IDs outside
  the retained VDYP7 polygon table; and
- recorded missing R1-to-VDYP diagnostics for downstream inventory and THLB
  recipe work.

## 2026-06-23 - Accepted the TFL 6 input-layer manifest

- wrote `data/input/tfl_6/input_layers_manifest.json` as the accepted input
  manifest for the active TFL 6 AOI;
- recorded the accepted TFL 6 boundary, clipped 2025 R1 polygon layer,
  filtered 2025 VDYP7 polygon table, and filtered 2025 VDYP7 layer table;
- updated source-inventory and K3Z adaptation notes so the original FDU 1/2/3
  AOI is historical provenance only, not the active model extraction boundary;
- marked `P1.6` complete in the roadmap; and
- unblocked reviewed source-layer and THLB netdown recipe planning under `#7`
  without starting recipe execution or Patchworks runtime-package work.
