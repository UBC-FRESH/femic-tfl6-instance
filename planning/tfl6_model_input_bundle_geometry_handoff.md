# TFL 6 P4.1c THLB Geometry Handoff

## Purpose

This note records the P4.1c handoff from the accepted Phase 2 THLB netdown lane
to the Phase 4 model-input bundle lane. It exists because the regenerated
geometry artifacts under `data/model_input_bundle/` are generated runtime
outputs, while the planning surface needs a tracked audit trail explaining what
was regenerated and how it should be consumed.

Important correction for P4.1c.2: this final THLB geometry is a state surface
for managed-share accounting, not a separate Patchworks stand universe. The
downstream Patchworks model stand universe is the AFLB resultant-fragment
surface produced by the accepted spatial netdown overlays. THLB is a managed
subset of AFLB, and `NTHLB = AFLB - THLB` remains in the model as
unmanaged/full-retention forest. Every AFLB resultant fragment still needs an
untreated VDYP curve so retained forest can grow and report residual inventory
through time.

## Regeneration Command

The final THLB geometry was regenerated from the accepted clipped 2025 TFL 6 R1
VRI input using the reviewed THLB recipe:

```powershell
python -m femic tsr thlb-netdown-run `
  --instance-root external/femic-tfl6-instance `
  --thlb-netdown-recipe-path config/tsr/thlb_netdown.recipe.yaml `
  --checkpoint-path data/input/tfl_6/vri_2025_r1_poly_tfl6.gpkg `
  --output-path data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_current.feather `
  --audit-path data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_checkpoint_manifest.json `
  --execution-mode reconstructed `
  --parallel-mode serial
```

The GeoPackage mirror was then written from the Feather handoff so downstream
tools that prefer OGR-compatible inputs can inspect the same geometry:

- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_current.feather`
- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_current.gpkg`
- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_checkpoint_manifest.json`

## Direct Inspection

- Source input: `data/input/tfl_6/vri_2025_r1_poly_tfl6.gpkg`
- Recipe: `config/tsr/thlb_netdown.recipe.yaml`
- CRS: `EPSG:3005`
- Rows: `29892`
- Geometry type: `MultiPolygon`
- Feather size: `31636290` bytes
- GeoPackage size: `60403712` bytes
- Manifest size: `52935` bytes
- Total geometry area: `186567.162340 ha`
- Weighted THLB area using `thlb_fact`: `144203.484774 ha`
- Manifest final managed area: `144203.48477359748 ha`

The weighted THLB area matches the accepted Phase 2 benchmark. For this handoff,
`thlb_fact` is the authoritative final THLB weighting field. The positive
geometry area alone is not the final THLB area because several accepted
aspatial fallback deductions are represented fractionally.

## Companion Outputs

The THLB runner also wrote companion AFLB and LHLB checkpoint partitions under
`runtime/logs/tsr/lu_partitions/` and reported an AFLB checkpoint area of
`196833.177 ha` in `config/tsr/thlb_reconstructed.status.md`. For P4.1c.2, the
AFLB checkpoint or an equivalent rematerialized `aflb_current` handoff is the
correct resultant-fragment universe. The THLB checkpoint recorded above should
be reconciled against that AFLB universe to compute managed and retained
shares.

If an AFLB or LHLB restart checkpoint is needed as a stable bundle artifact, it
should be regenerated or reconstructed deliberately under
`data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/` and either added to the accepted
artifact policy or treated as local runtime cache.

## AFLB Resultant-Fragment Handoff

P4.1c.2 rematerialized the accepted AFLB checkpoint partitions into the
canonical generated input-geometry handoff:

- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/aflb_current.feather`
- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/aflb_current.gpkg`
- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/aflb_checkpoint_manifest.json`

The handoff concatenates the 13 LU partition Feather files under
`runtime/logs/tsr/lu_partitions/aflb_checkpoint.6a351f3a223a/`, preserves the
runner-supplied identifiers, and adds:

- `aflb_fragment_id`: stable generated row key for the AFLB resultant-fragment
  universe;
- `lu_partition`: source LU partition name; and
- `aflb_area_ha`: geometry area in hectares.

Direct inspection:

- Generated UTC: `2026-06-26T15:25:11.807293+00:00`
- CRS: `EPSG:3005`
- Rows: `26186`
- Geometry type: `MultiPolygon`
- Total AFLB resultant-fragment area: `196833.176646 ha`
- Unique `FEATURE_ID`: `25796`
- Duplicate `FEATURE_ID` rows: `780`
- Unique `SOURCE_FEATURE_ID`: `24764`
- Duplicate `SOURCE_FEATURE_ID` rows: `2443`
- Empty geometry: `0`
- Null geometry: `0`
- Invalid geometry: `0`

Duplicate source identifiers are expected because the LU-partitioned,
resultant-fragment surface can split one source polygon into multiple
Patchworks fragments. The generated `aflb_fragment_id` is therefore the stable
P4.1c row key for bundle-table construction.

## Scope Boundary

This pass regenerated the final THLB/NTHLB state handoff and materialized the
AFLB resultant-fragment handoff. It did not build bundle CSV tables,
ForestModel XML, Matrix Builder outputs, a Patchworks runtime package, or Phase
5 publication policy work.

The next P4.1c move is to build the first core model-input bundle tables from
the AFLB resultant-fragment universe, this THLB/NTHLB managed-share state
surface, and the accepted AU, curve, treatment, transition, cedar, and
embedded-identity contracts.
