# TFL 6 P4.1c THLB Geometry Handoff

## Purpose

This note records the P4.1c handoff from the accepted Phase 2 THLB netdown lane
to the Phase 4 model-input bundle lane. It exists because the regenerated
geometry artifacts under `data/model_input_bundle/` are generated runtime
outputs, while the planning surface needs a tracked audit trail explaining what
was regenerated and how it should be consumed.

Important correction for P4.1c.2: this final THLB geometry is an overlay for
managed-share accounting, not the complete Patchworks stand universe. The
downstream Patchworks model stand universe is AFLB. THLB is a managed subset of
AFLB, and `NTHLB = AFLB - THLB` remains in the model as unmanaged/full-retention
forest. Every AFLB stand still needs an untreated VDYP curve so retained forest
can grow and report residual inventory through time.

## Regeneration Command

The final THLB geometry was regenerated from the accepted clipped 2025 TFL 6 R1
VRI input using the reviewed THLB recipe:

```powershell
python -m femic tsr thlb-netdown-run `
  --instance-root external/femic-tfl6-instance `
  --thlb-netdown-recipe-path config/tsr/thlb_netdown.recipe.yaml `
  --checkpoint-path data/input/tfl_6/vri_2025_r1_poly_tfl6.gpkg `
  --output-path data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_current.feather `
  --audit-path data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_checkpoint_manifest.json `
  --execution-mode reconstructed `
  --parallel-mode serial
```

The GeoPackage mirror was then written from the Feather handoff so downstream
tools that prefer OGR-compatible inputs can inspect the same geometry:

- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_current.feather`
- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_current.gpkg`
- `data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/thlb_checkpoint_manifest.json`

## Direct Inspection

- Generated UTC: `2026-06-26T13:59:08.454708+00:00`
- Source input: `data/input/tfl_6/vri_2025_r1_poly_tfl6.gpkg`
- Recipe: `config/tsr/thlb_netdown.recipe.yaml`
- CRS: `EPSG:3005`
- Rows: `29892`
- Geometry type: `MultiPolygon`
- Feather size: `31636290` bytes
- GeoPackage size: `60403712` bytes
- Manifest size: `52935` bytes
- Total geometry area: `186567.162340 ha`
- Weighted THLB area using `thlb_fact`: `144203.484774 ha`
- Manifest final managed area: `144203.48477359748 ha`

The weighted THLB area matches the accepted Phase 2 benchmark. For this handoff,
`thlb_fact` is the authoritative final THLB weighting field. The positive
geometry area alone is not the final THLB area because several accepted
aspatial fallback deductions are represented fractionally.

## Companion Outputs

The THLB runner also wrote companion AFLB and LHLB checkpoint partitions under
`runtime/logs/tsr/lu_partitions/` and reported an AFLB checkpoint area of
`196833.177 ha` in `config/tsr/thlb_reconstructed.status.md`. For P4.1c.2, the
AFLB checkpoint or an equivalent rematerialized `aflb_current` handoff is the
correct stand-table universe. The THLB checkpoint recorded above should be
overlaid back onto that AFLB universe to compute managed and retained shares.

If an AFLB or LHLB restart checkpoint is needed as a stable bundle artifact, it
should be regenerated or reconstructed deliberately under
`data/model_input_bundle/input_geometry/` and either added to the accepted
artifact policy or treated as local runtime cache.

## Scope Boundary

This pass regenerated the final THLB overlay handoff only. It did not build the
AFLB stand-universe handoff, bundle CSV tables, ForestModel XML, Matrix Builder
outputs, a Patchworks runtime package, or Phase 5 publication policy work.

The next P4.1c move is to build the first core model-input bundle tables from
the AFLB stand universe, this THLB managed-share overlay, and the accepted AU,
curve, treatment, transition, cedar, and embedded-identity contracts.
