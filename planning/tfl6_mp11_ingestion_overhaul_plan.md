# TFL 6 MP11 Ingestion And Model-Overhaul Planning

## Purpose

Phase 6 opens the planning lane for ingesting Western Forest Products' June
2026 TFL 6 Management Plan 11 package and comparing its public timber-supply
evidence against the completed Phase 5 FEMIC/Patchworks teaching prototype.

The current Phase 5 package remains the baseline prototype. It was built from
the public MP10-era planning record, 2025 public inventory inputs, reviewed
TFL 6 source-layer/THLB contracts, and the first teaching Patchworks runtime
release. Phase 6 does not retroactively invalidate that package. It creates the
reviewed evidence base needed before a future MP11-aligned overhaul can begin.

## Source Package

- Source URL:
  `https://www.westernforest.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/06/TFL6_MP_11_202606_w_Appendices_Web-compressed.pdf`
- Public-release context: June 2026 WFP TFL 6 Management Plan 11 package.
- Source-access smoke on 2026-06-27: the public PDF responded as an
  `application/pdf` and reported 475 pages. P6.1 still needs the local
  source/provenance manifest, checksum, and extraction-readiness record.
- P6.1 source/provenance manifest:
  `planning/tfl6_mp11_source_package_manifest.md`
- Machine-readable source/provenance record:
  `planning/tfl6_mp11_source_package_manifest.json`
- Document-component table:
  `planning/tfl6_mp11_document_components.csv`
- Extraction-manifest field contract:
  `planning/tfl6_mp11_extraction_manifest_fields.csv`
- Verified source facts on 2026-06-28:
  - page count: `475`;
  - byte size: `9147004`;
  - SHA256:
    `44591c1024254e36d8989df45a2b489a624d5669c5ae01a6ebfd961b50a7321b`;
  - checksum status: `passed`;
  - PDF producer: `Pdftools SDK`; and
  - PyMuPDF inspection version: `1.27.2.3`.
- Expected document layers, to be verified in the P6.1/P6.2 extraction
  manifest:
  - Management Plan front matter;
  - Appendix A: Timber Supply Analysis report; and
  - Appendix B: Information Package.
- Governance caveat: treat the package as a public planning and AAC-analysis
  source. Do not describe its AAC analysis as a final Chief Forester AAC
  determination unless a separate approved decision is located and reviewed.

## Issue Tree

- Parent: `#42` Phase 6: ingest MP11 and plan TFL6 model overhaul.
- `#43` P6.1: archive MP11 source package and extraction manifest.
- `#44` P6.2: extract MP11 tables, figures, sections, assumptions, and
  metadata.
- `#45` P6.3: compare MP11 land base and THLB assumptions against the Phase 5
  prototype.
- `#46` P6.4: compare MP11 inventory, LiDAR/ITI, yield, operability, and
  harvest-system assumptions.
- `#47` P6.5: compare MP11 model behavior, sensitivities, AAC recommendation,
  and KPI outputs.
- `#48` P6.6: write the Phase 7+ implementation roadmap for the MP11-aligned
  model overhaul.

## Extraction Scope

The extraction inventory must cover the full PDF package, not only the headline
AAC discussion. Every extracted claim must carry enough provenance to be
auditable later:

- document layer;
- section heading;
- page anchor;
- table or figure number where available;
- extracted text or normalized structured value;
- extraction method;
- manual-review status;
- comparison target in the Phase 5 prototype, if applicable; and
- adoption status: raw extraction, reviewed evidence, accepted model contract,
  rejected/deferred, or unresolved.

The first P6.2 raw extraction inventory is:

- `planning/tfl6_mp11_extraction_inventory.csv`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_extraction_inventory_summary.json`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_extraction_inventory_summary.md`

It contains `1870` raw candidate rows:

- `245` heading candidates;
- `287` table candidates;
- `244` figure candidates; and
- `1094` high-priority claim candidates.

The rows are intentionally conservative: `review_status` is `raw_extraction`,
downstream use is `phase6_inventory_triage_only`, and `model_input_status` is
`not_model_input`. Table-of-contents/list entries and repeated references may
appear in this queue; those are expected to be filtered during the next
P6.2/P6.3-P6.5 review and crosswalk passes.

## P6.3 Land-Base And THLB Comparison

The P6.3 comparison surfaces are:

- `planning/tfl6_mp11_land_base_crosswalk.md`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_land_base_crosswalk.csv`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_land_base_crosswalk.json`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_netdown_delta_crosswalk.md`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_netdown_delta_crosswalk.csv`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_netdown_delta_crosswalk.json`

The headline P6.3 finding is that MP11 total land base is effectively aligned
with the Phase 5 FADM-derived AOI after rounding, but MP11 current THLB is
substantially lower:

- MP11 current THLB: `120,099 ha`;
- Phase 5 accepted weighted THLB: `139,995.798 ha`;
- delta: `-19,896.798 ha`, or `-14.21%`.

The netdown/source-layer crosswalk separates public-layer rebuild candidates
from proxy/sensitivity assumptions and model-constraint changes. This makes the
future MP11-aligned implementation lane a source-layer/THLB overhaul, not a
small parameter tweak to the Phase 5 teaching package.

At minimum, P6.2 should inventory:

- section headings and appendices;
- tables, figures, maps, references, and footnotes;
- land-base and THLB assumptions;
- source-layer descriptions;
- inventory, LiDAR, and individual-tree-inventory inputs;
- operability, economic operability, terrain, karst, roads, riparian,
  OGMA/WHA, retention, and biodiversity assumptions;
- analysis-unit definitions;
- natural and managed yield assumptions;
- OAF, utilization, non-recoverable loss, and silvicultural-system rules;
- forest-cover constraints, minimum harvest age, harvest scheduling rules, and
  harvest-flow objectives;
- base-case outputs, alternate harvest flows, sensitivity analyses, and AAC
  recommendation evidence; and
- cedar, old-cedar, species-composition, age-class, volume-class,
  elevation-band, harvest-system, and other reported KPI outputs.

## Initial Review Targets

The following items are high-priority targets for extraction and crosswalk.
They are not accepted model facts until P6.2/P6.3 records page anchors and
review status:

- total TFL area;
- productive forest area;
- timber harvesting land base;
- non-contributing land base;
- changed land-base netdown categories relative to the MP10-derived prototype;
- VRI/LiDAR/ITI input vintage and usage;
- analysis-unit and growth-and-yield changes;
- base-case harvest flow and AAC recommendation;
- sensitivity-analysis structure and reported effects; and
- cedar, old-cedar, harvest-system, elevation-band, and species-composition
  outputs that can be compared with or added to the Patchworks teaching
  reporting surface.

## P6.4 Inventory, Yield, Operability, And Harvest-System Comparison

The P6.4 comparison surfaces are:

- `planning/tfl6_mp11_inventory_yield_operability_crosswalk.md`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_inventory_yield_operability_crosswalk.csv`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_inventory_yield_operability_crosswalk.json`

The crosswalk contains `14` reviewed assumption-family rows, all classified as
`reviewed_evidence`, `phase6_assumption_comparison_only`, and
`not_model_input`. The rows cover:

- VRI, LiDAR, LEFI, LBB, and ITI inventory inputs;
- physical and economic operability;
- MP11 AU definitions by era, BEC variant, site series, leading species, and
  silvicultural treatments;
- VDYP 7.33b and TIPSY 4.6 growth-and-yield software;
- SIBEC/TEM/RESULTS/LEFI site-index assumptions;
- managed-stand density, genetic gain, fertilization, and spacing inputs;
- OAF, VRAF, retention, utilization, and non-recoverable loss assumptions;
- 95% CMAI plus `350 m3/ha` minimum-harvest-age rules;
- ground/cable/non-conventional harvest-system distributions; and
- Patchworks spatial harvest rules and public/private resource-constraint
  reproducibility gaps.

The main P6.4 conclusion is that MP11 alignment is a model-overhaul problem,
not a small Phase 5 parameter edit. At minimum, the follow-on implementation
roadmap needs separate lanes for public inventory refresh, unavailable
LiDAR/ITI/LBB gaps, AU/yield contract decisions, MP11 managed-yield table
extraction, harvest-system classification, MHA rule extraction, OAF/VRAF and
retention updates, NRL handling, and Patchworks constraint review.

None of these rows change the Phase 5 teaching runtime package. They define
what a later MP11-aligned implementation phase must decide, reproduce, proxy,
or explicitly mark as unavailable from public inputs.

## P6.5 Model Behavior, Sensitivities, AAC, And KPI Comparison

The P6.5 comparison surfaces are:

- `planning/tfl6_mp11_model_behavior_crosswalk.md`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_model_behavior_crosswalk.csv`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_model_behavior_crosswalk.json`
- `planning/tfl6_mp11_model_behavior_scenario_endpoints.csv`

The crosswalk contains `8` reviewed behavior/KPI rows and `18` normalized
scenario endpoint rows. All rows are `reviewed_evidence`,
`phase6_model_behavior_comparison_only`, and `not_model_input`.

Headline MP11 values recorded for comparison planning:

- current AAC: `1,362,000 m3/year`;
- MP11 Base Case: `1,061,600 m3/year`;
- MP11 AAC recommendation: `1,252,700 m3/year`;
- Phase 7 figure closeout status: `22` figures accepted for comparison, `14`
  figures reviewed for planning only, `20` deferred, `5` qualitative context,
  and `0` model inputs.

The main P6.5 conclusion is that the Phase 5 teaching runtime is structurally
useful but not MP11-behavior-equivalent. It has a launch-smoked Patchworks
package and generic managed `CC` harvest signal, but no accepted
AAC-equivalent base-case calibration, no MP11 sensitivity suite, no
ground/cable/heli classifier, and no MP11-style growing-stock, species,
elevation, cedar, age-class, or old-seral KPI reporting surface.

Future implementation planning should use P6.5 to split the MP11-aligned
overhaul into:

- AAC/base-case calibration targets;
- harvest-flow policy and objective definitions;
- yield and policy sensitivity suites;
- AAC-recommendation scenario design;
- growing-stock and operational KPI reports;
- harvest-system classifier and reports; and
- cedar, age-class, and old-seral KPI validation before promotion beyond
  planning evidence.

## Phase 5 Baseline Surfaces

Phase 6 comparisons should start from the accepted Phase 5 surfaces, including:

- `planning/tfl6_thlb_benchmark_tolerance.md`;
- `planning/tfl6_source_layer_recipe_contracts.md`;
- `planning/tfl6_au_yield_curve_contract.md`;
- `planning/tfl6_cedar_signal_design.md`;
- `planning/tfl6_nicf_embedded_identity.md`;
- `planning/tfl6_model_input_bundle_qa.md`;
- `planning/tfl6_runtime_package_p44.md`;
- `planning/tfl6_runtime_release_archive_manifest.md`;
- `planning/tfl6_phase5_release_qa.md`;
- `docs/phase5-runtime-release.rst`;
- `docs/phase5-rebuild-provenance.rst`; and
- the accepted Phase 5 release archive and manifest.

## Non-Goals

Phase 6 must not perform model overhaul implementation. Specifically, do not:

- rerun THLB;
- regenerate VDYP or TIPSY yield curves;
- rewrite model-input bundle contracts;
- regenerate ForestModel XML;
- run Matrix Builder;
- rebuild or republish the Patchworks runtime archive;
- claim equivalence to WFP's unpublished forest estate model; or
- replace the Phase 5 teaching release before reviewed MP11 deltas have been
  extracted, crosswalked, and scoped into Phase 7+ implementation work.

## Expected Phase 6 Output

The phase should end with:

- a source/provenance manifest for the MP11 package;
- structured extraction artifacts with page anchors and review status;
- a land-base/THLB crosswalk against the Phase 5 prototype;
- an inventory/yield/operability/harvest-system assumption crosswalk;
- a model-behavior, sensitivity, AAC, and KPI comparison memo; and
- a Phase 7+ roadmap with parent/child issue structure for any accepted
  MP11-aligned implementation overhaul.
