# TFL 6 MP11 Phase 8 Closeout

## Purpose

This note closes Phase 8: MP11-aligned public-data implementation foundation.
Phase 8 converted reviewed Phase 6/7 MP11 evidence into implementation-ready
contracts while preserving the Phase 5 teaching runtime as the accepted
baseline.

Phase 8 did not rebuild source layers, THLB, yield curves, model-input
bundles, ForestModel XML, Matrix Builder outputs, Patchworks runtime packages,
or MP11 comparison reports.

## Completed Contracts

| Contract | Path | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline and evidence promotion | `planning/tfl6_mp11_baseline_and_promotion_contract.md` | Preserves Phase 5 baseline and defines MP11 evidence-promotion states. |
| Source-layer and THLB rebuild | `planning/tfl6_mp11_source_layer_thlb_rebuild_contract.md` | Defines public-source, proxy, sensitivity, unavailable, benchmark, and ordered-overlay rules. |
| AU/yield strategy | `planning/tfl6_mp11_au_yield_strategy_contract.md` | Preserves stable FEMIC AU identity and scopes MP11 crosswalk/parameter surfaces. |
| Operability, harvest-system, MHA, scenario rules | `planning/tfl6_mp11_operability_harvest_mha_scenario_contract.md` | Separates stand-level rules from AU identity and scenario comparisons from model inputs. |
| KPI, QA, reporting | `planning/tfl6_mp11_kpi_qa_reporting_contract.md` | Defines comparison targets, validation strengths, KPI schemas, tolerances, and report requirements. |

## Follow-On Phase Issues

The actual MP11 rebuild is split into future parent issues:

- Phase 9: MP11 source-layer and THLB rebuild (`#66`);
- Phase 10: MP11 AU/yield curve rebuild (`#67`);
- Phase 11: MP11 model-input bundle and ForestModel XML rebuild (`#68`);
- Phase 12: MP11 Patchworks runtime and scenario smoke (`#69`);
- Phase 13: MP11 comparison documentation and release QA (`#70`).

These phases must proceed in dependency order unless a later maintainer
decision explicitly narrows or reorders a slice.

## Baseline Boundary

The Phase 5 teaching runtime remains the accepted public baseline until a
future MP11-aligned replacement passes source-layer, THLB, AU/yield,
model-input, XML, Matrix Builder, Patchworks launch, scenario-output, Sphinx,
archive, and manifest QA.

MP11 values remain comparison or planning evidence unless a later phase
explicitly promotes them through the accepted evidence-promotion rules.

## Validation

Phase 8 closeout validation:

```bash
python -m ruff check .
sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html -W
```

Both commands passed before closeout.

## Private-Data Hygiene

Phase 8 used public MP11 evidence, tracked public-safe summaries, and existing
repo planning artifacts only. It did not track private WFP layers, unpublished
source tables, private prompt logs, generated runtime scratch outputs, or
proprietary model assumptions.
