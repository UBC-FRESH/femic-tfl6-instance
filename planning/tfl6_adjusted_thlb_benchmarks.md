# TFL 6 Adjusted THLB Benchmarks

## Purpose

This note defines provisional current-AOI THLB validation targets by scaling
the 2011 Management Plan 10 Table 4 netdown values to the accepted P1.6
FADM-derived TFL 6 AOI.

Governing issue: `#7`.

These are approximate validation benchmarks only. They are not accepted
reconstructed THLB outputs and they do not replace spatial recipe execution.

## Scaling Contract

| Quantity | Area ha |
| --- | ---: |
| MP10 Table 4 historical GLB | `171,441` |
| P1.6 current FADM-derived TFL 6 AOI | `217,042.718950` |
| Scale factor | `1.265990742879474571426904883` |
| Instrument 101 labelled additions | `44,612 + 2,096 = 46,708` |

Instrument 101 explains most or all of the current-vs-MP10 AOI delta, so the
working benchmark strategy is to scale MP10 Table 4 to the accepted current
FADM AOI. The scale factor uses the accepted current AOI area rather than the
rounded Instrument 101 map-label addition total.

This is intentionally good-enough benchmark logic for a teaching and learning
instance. The remaining area mismatch may reflect smaller net-outs, parcel
cleanup, boundary-vintage differences, or other post-MP10 tenure changes. A
possible K3Z/community-forest carve-out is noted as an unverified candidate,
not as an accepted fact.

## Working Targets

- `Total productive forest`: `186175.333 ha`
- `Total operable`: `170428.940 ha`
- `Current THLB`: `136487.728 ha`
- `Long-term landbase`: `134598.870 ha`

## Caveats

- Uniform scaling assumes the 2015 addition areas have similar netdown
  proportions to the 2011 MP10 landbase.
- The targets are suitable for early validation tolerance bands, not for final
  accounting lock values.
- Current-AOI spatial recipe outputs should replace these scaled targets once
  source layers and recipe skeletons are reviewed.
- Keep the historical MP10 Table 4 values visible alongside these adjusted
  targets in reports.
- Do not use these scaled values as final lock values for legal/accounting
  reconciliation.
