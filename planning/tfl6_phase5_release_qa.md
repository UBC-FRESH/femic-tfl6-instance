# TFL 6 Phase 5 Release QA

## Purpose

This checklist records final release QA for the first TFL 6 teaching runtime
package. It is the Phase 5 closeout evidence surface for issue `#40` under
Phase 5 parent `#15`.

The goal is to prove that the release is public, documented, materializable,
launch-smoked, and honest about its first-release limitations. This checklist
does not reopen model design, THLB netdown, yield curves, Matrix Builder, or
runtime-package construction unless QA exposes a release-blocking defect.

## Release Inputs

- Runtime archive: `releases/tfl6_patchworks_runtime_p5_2.zip`
- Runtime manifest: `releases/tfl6_patchworks_runtime_p5_2_manifest.yaml`
- Public annex remote: `arbutus-s3`
- Runtime launch file inside package:
  `models/tfl6_patchworks_model/analysis/base.pin`
- Representative harvest product:
  `product.HarvestedVolume.managed.Total.CC`
- Release docs:
  - `docs/phase5-runtime-release.rst`
  - `docs/phase5-runtime-quickstart.rst`
  - `docs/phase5-rebuild-provenance.rst`
  - `docs/phase5-scenario-teaching-workflows.rst`
  - `docs/phase5-known-limitations-release-readiness.rst`

## QA Checklist

| ID | Check | Evidence | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P5.4a | Create release-QA issue and checklist surface. | Issue `#40`; this file; Phase 5 parent `#15` body updated. | Pass | Created before executable QA checks. |
| P5.4b | Verify archive, manifest, and public materialization. | Fresh no-credential clone on `feature/p5-publication-release`; `git annex enableremote arbutus-s3`; `git annex info arbutus-s3`; `git annex get` archive and manifest; `git annex fsck`; Python SHA/size/ZIP-member validation. | Pass | `creds: not available`; `public: yes`; `remote annex keys: 2`; archive SHA256 `17f56d11faeba89170fc48e202d1bfe83c2dd40b53e7409d8cdb8c1c487c2f9f`; size `28000736`; ZIP members `31`; required launch/XML/tracks/block members present. |
| P5.4c | Verify Patchworks launch and baseline signal smoke evidence. | `lineage_registry.yaml`; saved-stage target CSVs under `models/tfl6_patchworks_model/analysis/p44d_harvest_smoke200/`; release ZIP member/track-table inspection. | Pass | Accepted launch run `tfl6_p44b_launch0` returned `0` and wrote `903` saved-stage files; scenario smoke `tfl6_p44d_harvest_smoke200` returned `0`, wrote `903` saved-stage files, scheduled `801` managed `CC` rows, and produced nonzero managed `CC` harvested-volume, treated-area, managed/unmanaged area, and managed/unmanaged yield signals. The release ZIP contains the launch helpers, ForestModel XML, and track tables carrying the required baseline signal names. |
| P5.4d | Verify docs build, docs links, and published Pages surface. | TBD | Pending | Sphinx warning-clean plus public documentation availability. |
| P5.4e | Close Phase 5 after QA evidence is recorded. | TBD | Pending | Close issue `#40` and parent `#15` only after QA passes. |

## Deferred Follow-On Scope

The following items are documented follow-on work and do not block the first
teaching release:

- ground/cable/heli harvest-system modeling;
- geometry-backed strategic RMZ replacement;
- outside-AOI NICF expansion implementation;
- cedar-specific reserve or utility-pole-grade policy design;
- VDYP/TIPSY sensitivity projects; and
- production-grade economic modeling.

## Current Status

P5.4c is complete. The accepted lineage registry records successful direct
launch smoke `tfl6_p44b_launch0` and representative scenario smoke
`tfl6_p44d_harvest_smoke200`, both with return code `0`, the
`[FEMIC headless] saveStage completed` marker, and `903` saved-stage files.
The scenario smoke schedule contains `801` managed `CC` rows and the saved
target outputs include nonzero `product.HarvestedVolume.managed.Total.CC`,
`product.Treated.managed.CC`, `feature.Area.managed`,
`feature.Area.unmanaged`, `feature.Yield.managed.Total`, and
`feature.Yield.unmanaged.Total` signals. Release ZIP inspection confirmed the
published archive carries the required launch scripts, ForestModel XML, track
tables, and baseline signal names. The next bounded slice is P5.4d docs build,
docs links, and published Pages verification.
