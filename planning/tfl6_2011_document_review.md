# TFL 6 2011 Document Review

## Purpose

This note records the first reviewed `P1.7b` pass over the 2011 TFL 6
Management Plan 10 document family for land-base, source-layer, yield, and
THLB netdown assumptions. It is a planning surface only: no source-layer or
THLB recipe execution is accepted here.

Governing issue: `#7`.

## Candidate Source-Layer and Recipe Strategy

These are extraction candidates, not accepted recipe steps. P1.7c/P1.7d should
separate reusable TSA29 workflow patterns from TFL/general-FMU adaptation gaps
before any YAML recipe surface is promoted.

| Candidate | Source document anchor | Likely source-layer strategy | Initial recipe-stage classification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TFL 6 AOI | P1.6 accepted input manifest; MP10 Table 4 for historical benchmark | Use `data/source/tfl_6/aoi/tfl_6_boundary.gpkg` as current AOI; retain MP10 total area as historical benchmark only. | source acquisition / benchmark reconciliation |
| Non-forest | Information package Table 5 | Derive from 2025 R1 BCLCS/non-vegetated/non-forest attributes where possible; verify against source inventory semantics. | checkpoint-attribute exclusion |
| Existing roads | Information package Table 6 | Requires a road-line/source layer or VRI road polygons; existing-road width assumptions may require reproducible buffering. | exact spatial overlay or derived source layer |
| Non-productive forest | Information package Table 7 | Candidate VRI non-productive descriptor / productivity group / ecosite fields; needs mapping from MP10 ecosite/PG5 definitions to current data. | checkpoint-attribute exclusion |
| Operability/inoperability | Information package Table 8 | Needs operability class source. If no public equivalent is available, treat as local/reviewed source requirement. | source acquisition plus exact spatial/attribute exclusion |
| Terrain stability | Information package Section 6.6 and analysis Section 4.1 | Base case used no additional netdown except areas already classed inoperable; sensitivity considered Class V plus heli. | review-only baseline plus sensitivity candidate |
| Riparian management | Information package Table 9 | Requires stream/lake/wetland/ocean shoreline layers plus retention-width assumptions; likely reproducible overlay/buffer recipe. | exact spatial overlay plus aspatial retention factors |
| Ungulate winter range | Information package Table 10 | Public UWR spatial layer candidate. | exact spatial overlay |
| OGMAs | Information package Table 11 and Section 10.2.3 | Public/current OGMA layers plus historical established/draft distinction; MP10 draft OGMAs may not match current legal layers. | exact spatial overlay plus historical benchmark decision |
| Wildlife habitat areas | Information package Table 12 | Public WHA spatial layer candidate; verify species/order IDs. | exact spatial overlay |
| Recreation sites/trails | Information package Table 13 | Requires recreation feature/trail layer and 10 m buffer assumption. | exact spatial overlay |
| Deciduous-leading forest | Information package Table 14 | Derive from R1 species-leading fields or VDYP species table where possible. | checkpoint-attribute exclusion |
| Cultural heritage resources | Information package Table 15 | Likely not fully public; document says incremental 1% netdown applies within EFZ and within 1 km of ocean. | aspatial benchmark deduction or derived spatial proxy |
| Stand-level retention | Information package Table 16 | Distributed by RMZ type, LU, and BEC subzone; requires RMZ/LU/BEC attribution and percentage netdown. | aspatial percent deduction by stratum |
| Future roads | Information package Table 17 | Requires projected-road source or aspatial future-road allowance. | model-time/aspatial deduction |
| Karst | Information package Section 6.16 | Base case applied no additional karst netdown, assuming stand-level retention covers required reserves. | review-only/manual note |

## Yield and Modelling Assumption Candidates

| Assumption | Source document anchor | FEMIC implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Productivity groups and site index | Information package Table 23 | TFL 6 used three productivity groups, species-specific SI values, and THLB area-weighted averages. Current 2025 inventory may require a new mapping from BEC/ecosite/productivity group to FEMIC strata. |
| Utilization | Information package Table 24 | Natural/unmanaged stands used 17.5 cm DBH; managed stands used 12.5 cm DBH. This affects yield-source comparability with current VDYP7/TIPSY surfaces. |
| TIPSY OAFs | Information package Section 8.3 | Managed-stand TIPSY used OAF1 10% and OAF2 5%. |
| Managed stand retention yield reduction | Information package Section 8.4.2 | Future managed stands had additional yield reductions by RMZ: 2% EFZ, 3% GMZ, 5% SMZ. |
| VDYP unmanaged lane | Information package Section 8.5 | Existing mature and unmanaged immature stands used VDYP-derived area-weighted yields by AU; current 2025 VDYP7 tables should be treated as a new source lane, not as proof that MP10 yields carry forward. |
| TIPSY managed lane | Information package Tables 27-29 | Existing and future managed stands used Batch TIPSY 4.1 with species composition, stocking, SI, genetic worth, fertilization, and regeneration-delay assumptions. |
| Fertilization | Information package Section 8.6.2 | Fertilization was incorporated into current/future yield tables; species-specific approach used next-higher productivity group for cedar/hemlock/spruce and default TIPSY increases for Douglas-fir. |
| Regeneration delay | Information package Section 8.6.5 | Planted future managed stands used one-year regeneration delay; naturally regenerated stands used three years. |
| Visual quality | Information package Table 31 | VQO classes M/PR/R used 25/15/5% disturbance limits and 15-year VEG surrogate. |
| Adjacency green-up | Information package Section 10.2.2 | Areas outside VQO polygons used 3 m/10-year green-up in GMZ/SMZ and 1.3 m/5-year green-up in EFZ with a 25% young-area proxy. |
| Old-seral constraints | Information package Table 32 | OGMAs satisfy first-rotation targets in some cases; 2/3 and full old-seral targets are phased by second and third rotations where needed. |
| Steep terrain harvest limits | Information package Table 33 | Specific watershed-level ten-year harvest caps were applied for steep terrain. |
| Minimum harvest criteria | Information package Table 35 | Minimum average DBH by harvest system: ground 30 cm, cable 37 cm, heli 42 cm; age ranges differ by productivity. |

## Benchmark Caveats

- The MP10 Table 4 total landbase is `171441 ha`; the current P1.6 TFL 6 FADM
  boundary area is about `217043 ha`. Future benchmarking must explain the
  boundary/date/source difference before treating MP10 THLB area as a direct
  target for the 2025 TFL 6 input set.
- MP10 uses 2009/2011-era inventory, operability, draft/legal OGMAs, VQO, UWR,
  WHA, and WFP local assumptions. Current public layers may not reproduce that
  historical state exactly.
- Several MP10 assumptions are explicitly model assumptions rather than source
  exclusions: stand-level retention percentages, future roads, karst as covered
  by retention, visual/adjacency constraints, heli harvest volume constraints,
  and managed-stand retention yield reductions.
- The information package is the extraction authority for source assumptions;
  the analysis report is best used to understand sensitivity and base-case
  consequence, not as the first source for defining the netdown sequence.

## P1.7c/P1.7d Handoff

Next planning slices should:

- split the table above into TSA29 carry-forward patterns versus TFL/general-FMU
  adaptation gaps;
- decide whether recipe skeletons live under the existing `config/tsr/` paths
  or a renamed/generalized TFL/FMUs recipe surface;
- draft initial source-layer and THLB netdown recipe tables without executing
  them;
- preserve MP10 historical benchmarks separately from current 2025 TFL 6 input
  areas; and
- identify which public BCDC layers must be resolved before any reproducible
  netdown recipe can run.
