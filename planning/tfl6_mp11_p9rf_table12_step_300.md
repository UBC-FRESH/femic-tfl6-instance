# TFL 6 MP11 P9RF mp11_t12_300 Less future roads

## Result

- Step kind: `deduction_proxy`
- Source area: `122,763.421 ha`
- Deducted area: `1,426.829 ha`
- Retained area: `121,336.593 ha`
- MP11 comparison target: `1,427.000 ha`
- Delta to MP11: `-0.171 ha` (`-0.0120%`)
- Input fragments: `40,529`
- Active fragments: `23,245`
- Deducted fragments: `17,284`
- Balance error: `-0.000000000 ha`
- Checkpoint status: `locked_p9rf_step300_aspatial_future_roads_proxy`

## Notes

Future roads are long-term land-base context, not current THLB. Because future road alignments are unknown, P9RF implements this row as an aspatial area netdown proxy using smallest-current resultant fragments to approximate the MP11 net deduction. The deducted fragments are an area accounting placeholder and must not be interpreted as predicted future road locations.
