- Feature count: `6`

| `FDU 6 Shushartie LU` | Shushartie | High | 15681.191 |

Interpretation:

- This zip contains a single shapefile family, but that shapefile is not a
  single dissolved AOI polygon. It is a six-feature FDU/LU-style layer.
- Treat `NICF_FDU_2024.shp` as the raw amendment source for the accepted
  three-FDU FSP AOI extraction documented below.
- Do not point runtime config directly at the raw zip payload.

| Tsulquate | Tsulquate | 23205.472 | 25638.715 | 2433.244 |

Interpretation:

- The LU zip is a broader BCGW landscape-unit clip with `27` full LU features,
  not a narrow three-LU package.
- The canonical LU reference context for this instance is the three BCGW LU
  records named by the FSP: Holberg, Keogh, and Marble.
- The remaining 24 BCGW LU records stay in the raw zip as provenance/context,
  not as tracked canonical runtime inputs.
- Each canonical FSP AOI feature is equal to or smaller than its corresponding
  full BCGW LU, so the AOI surface should be treated as the modelling boundary
  and the LU reference subset as context for FSP interpretation.

## FSP PDF Cross-Check

Inspection date: 2026-06-23

Source:
`data/source/nicf_fsp/nicf_forest_stewardship_plan_2020.pdf`

Text extraction:

- Tool: `pypdf`
- Page count: `29`
- Search terms: `FDU`, `Forest Development Unit`, `Holberg`, `Keogh`,
  `Marble`, `Nahwitti`, `Shushartie`, `Tsulquate`, `K3Z`

Key PDF evidence:

| PDF page | Evidence |
| ---: | --- |
| 8 | The FSP applies to Community Forest Agreement `K3Z` and says there are three proposed FDUs. It also says FDUs are meant to follow Landscape Unit boundaries where they overlap the tenure boundary and form a logical planning area. |
| 9 | The FSP lists the three proposed FDUs as `FDU 1 - Holberg Landscape Unit`, `FDU 2 - Keogh Landscape Unit`, and `FDU 3 - Marble Landscape Unit`. |
| 13 | Enhanced Forestry Zone applicability is stated for `FDU 1 (Holberg)` and `FDU 2 (Keogh)`. |
| 14 | Old-growth/objective text references `FDU 3 (Marble)` and draft OGMAs for Holberg and Keogh. |
| 15 | Marble LU OGMAs are referenced as applying within the FSP. |
| 22 | Community watershed text references `FDU #1 (Holberg Landscape Unit)`. |

PDF term counts:

| Term | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| `FDU` | 43 |
| `Forest Development Unit` | 1 |
| `Holberg` | 6 |
| `Keogh` | 5 |
| `Marble` | 10 |
| `Nahwitti` | 0 |
| `Shushartie` | 0 |
| `Tsulquate` | 0 |
| `K3Z` | 1 |

Interpretation:

- The 2020 FSP PDF supports the initial project-note expectation that the FSP
  references three relevant LUs: Holberg, Keogh, and Marble.
- The 2024 amendment spatial payload contains six FDU/LU labels:
  Holberg, Keogh, Marble, Nahwitti, Shushartie, and Tsulquate.
- The additional 2024 amendment names (`Nahwitti`, `Shushartie`, `Tsulquate`)
  do not appear in the 2020 PDF text extracted with `pypdf`.
- Project clarification resolves the modelling boundary as the provided
  amendment spatial boundary filtered to FDU 1 Holberg, FDU 2 Keogh, and
  FDU 3 Marble.

Current source-boundary status:

- Relevant LUs referenced by the 2020 FSP: Holberg, Keogh, Marble.
- Broader FDU names present in the 2024 amendment spatial payload:
  Holberg, Keogh, Marble, Nahwitti, Shushartie, Tsulquate.
- Accepted runtime AOI: see bootstrap AOI convention below.

## Bootstrap AOI Convention

Decision date: 2026-06-23

Decision:

- Use `NICF_FDU_2024.shp` from
  `data/source/nicf_fsp/nicf_fsp_amendment_3_spatial.zip` as the accepted
  bootstrap AOI source for the NICF FSP teaching instance.
- Filter the accepted FSP AOI boundary to the FSP's three FDUs only:
  FDU 1 Holberg, FDU 2 Keogh, and FDU 3 Marble.
- Treat the remaining amendment-payload features (`Nahwitti`, `Shushartie`,
  and `Tsulquate`) as raw source provenance/reference records, not as part of
  the FSP AOI for this instance.
- Treat a dissolved whole-AOI polygon as a generated runtime helper only, not
  as the canonical source record.
- Treat the 2020 FSP PDF three-FDU scope as the governing FSP AOI interpretation
  for the provided amendment spatial boundary.

Accepted source candidate:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Raw payload | `data/source/nicf_fsp/nicf_fsp_amendment_3_spatial.zip` |
| Path in zip | `NICF FSP Shapefiles/NICF_FDU_2024.shp` |
| Canonical feature semantics | Three preserved FSP AOI polygons: Holberg, Keogh, Marble |
| CRS | `EPSG:3005` |
| Geometry type | `Polygon` |
| Feature count | `3` |
| Total measured area | `147798.392 ha` |
| Bounds | `(849931.438, 580387.812, 928536.312, 639356.250)` |

Rationale:

- The bootstrap project note says to scale up to the new AOI uploaded as the
  amendment spatial payload.
- The provided spatial payload contains the FSP AOI boundary records, but the
  FSP AOI is only FDU 1, FDU 2, and FDU 3.
- The 2020 FSP document identifies Holberg, Keogh, and Marble as the three
  proposed FDUs, and the project clarification confirms only FDU 1, FDU 2, and
  FDU 3 make up the FSP AOI.
- Preserving FDU/LU feature identity keeps the teaching model able to report and
  reason at the FDU/LU level while still allowing a dissolved whole-AOI runtime
  boundary to be generated later if needed.

Open normalization work:

- Source-path wiring is recorded in `config/run_profile.nicffsp.yaml`.

Verification:

- Read path: `data/source/nicf_fsp/aoi/nicf_fsp_aoi.shp`
- Feature count: `3`
- Geometry type: `Polygon`
- CRS: `EPSG:3005`
- Bounds: `(849931.438, 580387.812, 928536.312, 639356.250)`
- Geometry validity: `3` valid, `0` invalid
- Total measured area in EPSG:3005: `147798.392 ha`
- Feature names: Holberg, Keogh, Marble

Interpretation:

- This extracted lowercase shapefile family is the accepted canonical source
  path for the bootstrap NICF FSP AOI.
- The original zip remains tracked as raw provenance for all six amendment
  features.
- `config/run_profile.nicffsp.yaml` now points `selection.boundary_path` at this
  accepted AOI source path.

## Canonical Extracted LU Reference Source

Extraction date: 2026-06-23

Decision:

- Track only the three FSP-relevant BCGW LU records as canonical reference
  context: Holberg, Keogh, and Marble.
- Keep the full 27-feature BCGW LU zip as raw provenance/context.
- Do not use the LU reference layer as the runtime AOI; the runtime AOI remains
  `data/source/nicf_fsp/aoi/nicf_fsp_aoi.shp`.

Verification:

- Read path: `data/source/nicf_fsp/lu_reference/nicf_lu_reference.shp`
- Feature count: `3`
- Geometry type: `Polygon`
- CRS: `EPSG:3005`
- Bounds: `(849931.438, 580387.813, 928536.312, 641215.125)`
- Geometry validity: `3` valid, `0` invalid
- Total measured area in EPSG:3005: `165588.857 ha`
- Feature names: Holberg, Keogh, Marble

Interpretation:

- This extracted lowercase shapefile family is the accepted canonical source
  path for LU reference context in the bootstrap NICF FSP instance.
- The raw BCGW LU zip remains tracked as provenance for the broader 27-feature
  clip.
- `config/run_profile.nicffsp.yaml` records this source as
  `selection.source_context.lu_reference_path`; the current FEMIC runtime
  consumes `selection.boundary_path` directly and carries LU reference context
  for downstream NICF adaptation work.
