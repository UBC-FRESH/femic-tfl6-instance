# TFL 6 THLB Netdown Steps

## Purpose

This note converts the TFL 6 Management Plan 10 information-package land-base
section into a reviewed, ordered THLB netdown planning table. It bridges
`planning/tfl6_2011_document_review.md` and a later non-executable recipe
skeleton.

Governing issue: `#7`.

No recipe YAML is created here and no netdown execution is authorized.

## Source Authority

Primary source:

- `reference/tfl_6_mngment_plan_2011_ip.pdf`
- extracted text: `reference/extracted_text/tfl_6_mngment_plan_2011_ip.txt`

Authoritative netdown backbone:

- Information Package Section 6.2, `Table 4 - Timber Harvesting Land Base for
  TFL 6`, printed page 12, extracted-text page 21.

Supporting detail:

- Section 6.3 / Table 5: non-forest.
- Section 6.4 / Table 6: existing roads.
- Section 6.5 / Table 7: non-productive forest.
- Section 6.6 / Table 8: operability.
- Section 6.7 / Table 9: riparian management.
- Section 6.8 / Table 10: ungulate winter ranges.
- Section 6.9 / Table 11: old growth management areas.
- Section 6.10 / Table 12: wildlife habitat areas.
- Section 6.11 / Table 13: recreation sites and trails.
- Section 6.12 / Table 14: deciduous-leading forest.
- Section 6.13 / Table 15: cultural heritage resources.
- Section 6.14.3 / Table 16: stand-level retention.
- Section 6.15 / Table 17: future roads.
- Section 6.16: caves and karst.

The information package says the detailed sections summarize the area deducted
from the land base in the order the categories appear in Table 4 and that
overlapping constraints are addressed in a hierarchy. That Table 4 order is the
governing order for this planning skeleton.

## Stage Mapping

TFL 6 MP10 does not use the TSA29 GLB/AFLB/LHLB/THLB labels directly. FEMIC
should preserve the literal MP10 Table 4 rows and add this tentative stage
interpretation for review:

| FEMIC stage | TFL 6 interpretation | Source-status note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GLB | Total MP10 analysis landbase. | Source wording: `Total Landbase`. |
| GLB -> AFLB | Remove non-forest, existing roads, and non-productive forest to reach productive forest. | Review interpretation, not MP10 wording. |
| AFLB | Productive forest checkpoint. | Source wording: `Total Productive`. |
| AFLB -> LHLB | Remove inoperable/uneconomic area to reach operable landbase. | Review interpretation: MP10 calls this `Total Operable`, not LHLB. |
| LHLB | Operable landbase before ordered resource reductions. | Source wording: `Total Operable`. |
| LHLB -> THLB | Apply ordered operable reductions and stand-level retention to reach current THLB. | Review interpretation; literal source rows are the Table 4 reductions. |
| THLB | Current timber harvesting land base. | Source wording: `Current THLB`. |
| Long-term THLB/LHLB adjustment | Deduct future roads to reach long-term landbase. | Source wording: `Long-term Landbase`; not part of current THLB. |

This mapping should be revisited during P1.7c before any recipe schema is
promoted, because some deductions such as operability, future roads, and
stand-level retention do not fit perfectly into the TSA29 stage vocabulary.

## Ordered Cumulative Netdown Table

Area values are from MP10 Table 4. Reduction values are total-area reductions
unless otherwise noted. The cumulative remaining area follows the printed Table
4 checkpoint sequence.

| Step ID | MP10 row / action | FEMIC stage | Reduction ha | Cumulative ha | Source anchor | Implementation/readiness note |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| tfl6_nd_000 | Total landbase | reference_target / GLB | 0 | 171441 | Table 4 | Historical MP10 analysis boundary. Current P1.6 FADM TFL 6 boundary is larger, so direct area benchmarking needs boundary reconciliation. |
| tfl6_nd_010 | Less non-forest | glb_to_aflb | 13483 | 157958 | Table 4; Table 5 | Candidate attribute exclusion from 2025 R1 BCLCS/non-forest/non-vegetated fields; verify category mapping to alpine, rock/slides, water/wetlands, dumps/camps/sorts, utility RoW, brush, and other. |
| tfl6_nd_020 | Less existing roads | glb_to_aflb | 3935 | 154023 | Table 4; Table 6 | Spatial line/polygon overlay candidate. MP10 used classified road polygons plus buffered unclassified road lines: highway 30 m, mainline 12 m, branch 10 m, spur/stub 8 m. Source road layer still needs resolution. |
| tfl6_nd_030 | Total forested | reference_target | 0 | 154023 | Table 4 | Milestone only, not a deduction. |
| tfl6_nd_040 | Less non-productive forest | glb_to_aflb | 6964 | 147059 | Table 4; Table 7 | Candidate VRI descriptor/productivity/ecosite exclusion. MP10 Table 7 includes non-productive and low-productivity ecosites CP, MH, MH1, S7, S8 / PG5. |
| tfl6_nd_050 | Total productive forest | reference_target / AFLB | 0 | 147059 | Table 4 | Proposed AFLB-style productive-forest checkpoint for FEMIC review. |
| tfl6_nd_060 | Less inoperable, including uneconomic | aflb_to_lhlb | 12438 | 134621 | Table 4; Table 8 | Requires operability class source. MP10 classes include physical inoperable `I` and marginal/economic classes `Ocm` and `Ohm`; no additional terrain-stability netdown was applied beyond inoperability. |
| tfl6_nd_070 | Total operable | reference_target / LHLB | 0 | 134621 | Table 4 | Proposed LHLB-style operable checkpoint for FEMIC review. |
| tfl6_nd_080 | Riparian management | lhlb_to_thlb | 10632 | 123989 | Table 4; Table 9 | Spatial overlay/buffer candidate. MP10 applies FRPA RRZ widths plus assumed RMZ retention by stream/lake/wetland class and a 40 m ocean shoreline reserve. Requires hydrography, lakes/wetlands, shoreline, class fields, and horizontal-distance buffer rules. |
| tfl6_nd_090 | Ungulate winter ranges | lhlb_to_thlb | 1313 | 122676 | Table 4; Table 10 | Spatial overlay candidate from UWR order data. MP10 references U-1-010 plus 5.3 ha from U-1-011 inside TFL 6 analysis boundary. |
| tfl6_nd_100 | Established OGMAs | lhlb_to_thlb | 3750 | 118926 | Table 4; Table 11 | Spatial overlay candidate. MP10 established OGMAs: Marble and San Josef. Current legal OGMA layer may differ from 2011 analysis state. |
| tfl6_nd_110 | Draft OGMAs | lhlb_to_thlb | 3469 | 115457 | Table 4; Table 11 | Historical/local source likely required. MP10 draft OGMAs: Holberg, Keogh, Mahatta, Neroutsos. Current public legal layers may not include 2011 draft geometry. |
| tfl6_nd_120 | Wildlife habitat areas | lhlb_to_thlb | 3 | 115454 | Table 4; Table 12 | Spatial overlay candidate from WHA layer. MP10 WHAs include 1-089, 1-106, 1-107, 1-199, 1-200, 1-201, and 1-202; most area overlaps prior OGMAs. |
| tfl6_nd_130 | Recreation sites and trails | lhlb_to_thlb | 50 | 115404 | Table 4; Table 13 | Spatial overlay/buffer candidate. MP10 says significant recreation features are netted out by applying a 10 m buffer. |
| tfl6_nd_140 | Deciduous-leading forest | lhlb_to_thlb | 1774 | 113630 | Table 4; Table 14 | Attribute exclusion candidate from R1/VDYP species-leading fields. MP10 excludes deciduous-leading stands while retaining deciduous volume components in conifer-leading stands. |
| tfl6_nd_150 | Cultural heritage resources | lhlb_to_thlb | 132 | 113498 | Table 4; Table 15 | Likely reviewed/aspatial or proxy spatial deduction. MP10 uses a 1% incremental netdown for TFL 6 area both within an EFZ and within 1 km of ocean; detailed TUS/CMT data are not normally public. |
| tfl6_nd_160 | Total operable reductions | reference_target | 21124 | 113497 | Table 4 | Milestone/check row. Small one-hectare discrepancy from sequential rounded reductions is from Table 4 rounding. |
| tfl6_nd_170 | Reduced landbase | reference_target | 0 | 113497 | Table 4 | Pre-stand-level-retention checkpoint. |
| tfl6_nd_180 | Less allowance for stand-level retention | lhlb_to_thlb | 5686 | 107811 | Table 4; Table 16 | Aspatial percent deduction by RMZ/LU/BEC stratum. MP10 distributes a 5.0% area-weighted THLB reduction rather than applying one uniform factor. Requires RMZ, LU, BEC attribution and Table 16 percentages. |
| tfl6_nd_190 | Current THLB | reference_target / THLB | 0 | 107811 | Table 4 | Current MP10 THLB benchmark. |
| tfl6_nd_200 | Less future roads | context / long_term_adjustment | 1491 | 106319 | Table 4; Table 17 | Future/model-time deduction. MP10 assumes 1,947 km of future branch road at 10 m width, reducing area as polygons are harvested. |
| tfl6_nd_210 | Long-term landbase | reference_target | 0 | 106319 | Table 4 | Long-term benchmark after future roads; do not confuse with current THLB. |

## Input Data Layer Requirements

The following input data surfaces need to be resolved or reviewed before an
executable TFL 6 netdown recipe can run.

| Requirement | MP10 step(s) | Expected layer type | Current status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accepted TFL 6 AOI and 2025 inventory | tfl6_nd_000 onward | Polygon inventory with `feature_id` join to VDYP tables | Accepted by P1.6 in `data/input/tfl_6/input_layers_manifest.json`. |
| Non-forest and non-productive attributes | tfl6_nd_010, tfl6_nd_040 | R1/VDYP attributes | Candidate fields exist in the clipped R1 table, but MP10 class mapping is not reviewed. |
| Road network | tfl6_nd_020, tfl6_nd_200 | Road lines/polygons, widths, existing/future distinction | Missing source-layer decision. Existing roads and future roads likely need separate treatment. |
| Operability | tfl6_nd_060 | Polygon/attribute source for `Oce`, `Ohe`, `I`, `Ocm`, `Ohm` or successor classes | Missing source-layer decision; may require WFP/local source or reviewed proxy. |
| Hydrography, lakes, wetlands, shoreline | tfl6_nd_080 | Classified line/polygon features with stream/lake/wetland class and ocean shoreline | Missing source-layer decision; needs buffer/rule implementation. |
| UWR | tfl6_nd_090 | Legal/order polygon layer | Public BCDC candidate; not yet resolved for TFL 6 IDs. |
| OGMAs, including draft 2011 state | tfl6_nd_100, tfl6_nd_110 | Established and draft OGMA polygons | Established OGMAs likely public; draft 2011 OGMAs may require historical/local source or non-current benchmark handling. |
| WHA | tfl6_nd_120 | WHA polygons with order/species IDs | Public BCDC candidate; not yet resolved for listed IDs. |
| Recreation features | tfl6_nd_130 | Recreation site/trail features | Missing source-layer decision; requires 10 m buffer rule. |
| Deciduous-leading stand signal | tfl6_nd_140 | Inventory species-leading fields | Candidate R1/VDYP attributes; exact species-lead definition needs review. |
| Cultural heritage resource proxy | tfl6_nd_150 | EFZ/RMZ plus 1 km ocean-proximity overlay, or reviewed aspatial deduction | Sensitive/local data likely unavailable; MP10 supports proxy/aspatial treatment. |
| RMZ, LU, BEC attribution | tfl6_nd_180 plus constraints | Polygons/attributes for RMZ type, landscape unit, BEC subzone | Required for stand-level retention percentages and old-seral/green-up constraints. |

## Milestone Comparison Contract

For future FEMIC recipe skeletons, keep three separate area stories visible:

| Story | Meaning | Current value |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| MP10 historical GLB | MP10 Table 4 total analysis landbase | 171441 ha |
| Current P1.6 AOI | 2025 TFL 6 FADM boundary accepted by FEMIC | 217042.718950 ha |
| MP10 productive/AFLB-style checkpoint | MP10 Table 4 total productive forest | 147059 ha |
| MP10 operable/LHLB-style checkpoint | MP10 Table 4 total operable landbase | 134621 ha |
| MP10 current THLB | MP10 Table 4 current timber harvesting land base | 107811 ha |
| MP10 long-term landbase | MP10 current THLB less future roads | 106319 ha |

Do not compare a current 2025 reconstructed TFL 6 THLB directly against the
MP10 THLB until the boundary/date/source difference is explicitly reconciled.

Post-2011 boundary-change evidence is recorded in
`planning/tfl6_instrument_boundary_reconciliation.md`. The leading hypothesis
is that Instrument 101, effective January 1, 2015, added TFL 39 Block 4 lands
to TFL 6 and explains most or all of the difference between the `171441 ha`
MP10 historical GLB and the `217042.718950 ha` current FADM-derived AOI.

Provisional scaled current-AOI validation targets are recorded in
`planning/tfl6_adjusted_thlb_benchmarks.md` and
`planning/tfl6_adjusted_thlb_benchmarks.json`. These uniformly scale MP10 Table
4 by the current-AOI/MP10-GLB factor and should be used only as approximate
early validation targets until spatial current-AOI recipe outputs supersede
them.

The P1.7c adaptation classification is recorded in
`planning/tfl6_recipe_adaptation_contract.md`.

## P1.7c/P1.7d Handoff

P1.7c classified each row above into:

- TSA29 workflow pattern that carries forward directly;
- TFL/general-FMU adaptation needed before recipe YAML;
- blocked missing source layer;
- reviewed aspatial fallback candidate; or
- context/reference target only.

P1.7d should draft non-executable recipe skeletons from this table and
`planning/tfl6_recipe_adaptation_contract.md`. The resulting P1.7d skeleton
planning tables are recorded in `planning/tfl6_recipe_skeletons.md`.
