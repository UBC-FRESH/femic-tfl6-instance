# TFL 6 Recipe Skeletons

## Purpose

This note drafts non-executable source-layer and THLB netdown recipe skeleton
planning tables for TFL 6.

Governing issue: `#7`.

This is a P1.7d planning surface. It proposes future recipe destinations and
review rows only. It does not create recipe YAML, download new source layers, or
run THLB netdown.

## Proposed Future Recipe Destinations

Use TFL/general-FMU successor paths instead of writing directly to the current
TSA-oriented `config/tsr/` recipe paths:

| Future path | Role | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config/tfl6/source_layers.recipe.yaml` | Future reviewed source-layer recipe for TFL 6. | Proposed only; not created in P1.7d. |
| `config/tfl6/thlb_netdown.recipe.yaml` | Future reviewed THLB netdown recipe for TFL 6. | Proposed only; not created in P1.7d. |
| `config/tfl6/overlay.yaml` | Future TFL/general-FMU reviewed assumption overlay, if FEMIC generalizes the current TSR overlay schema. | Proposed only; not created in P1.7d. |
| `config/tfl6/source_layer_overrides.yaml` | Future escape hatch for reviewed source-layer acquisition overrides. | Proposed only; not created in P1.7d. |

The existing TSA29 paths remain the implementation pattern:

- `config/tsr/source_layers.recipe.yaml`
- `config/tsr/thlb_netdown.recipe.yaml`
- `config/tsr/overlay.yaml`
- `config/tsr/source_layer_overrides.yaml`

Do not write TFL 6 YAML into `config/tsr/` unless FEMIC first generalizes those
schemas beyond TSA identity assumptions.

## Blocked Execution Notes

The following blockers must remain visible in any later recipe YAML:

- no reviewed R1/VDYP field map yet exists for non-forest, non-productive, or
  deciduous-leading exclusions;
- no accepted existing-road source exists;
- no accepted operability source or proxy exists;
- no accepted hydrology/wetland/shoreline bundle and MP10 riparian-rule mapping
  exists;
- UWR, WHA, and established OGMA public-layer IDs/vintage still need BCDC/FEMIC
  resolution;
- draft OGMAs likely need historical/local geometry or a reviewed aspatial
  fallback;
- cultural heritage data are sensitive and should not be represented as public
  source geometry;
- RMZ/LU/BEC stand-level retention attribution still needs source/schema
  decisions; and
- adjusted benchmark values are validation targets only, not executable source
  rows.

## P1.7 Closeout

This note completes the P1.7 planning lane:

- P1.7a indexed the source corpus;
- P1.7b reviewed the 2011 document assumptions;
- P1.7b1 recorded the ordered netdown backbone;
- P1.7b2 recorded Instrument 101 boundary context;
- P1.7b3 recorded adjusted current-AOI validation targets;
- P1.7c classified adaptation gaps; and
- P1.7d drafted non-executable skeleton planning tables.

The next implementation lane should be a new issue or follow-on task that
chooses one executable subset, starting with the accepted current-AOI inventory
attribute mapping before broader source acquisition or THLB execution.
