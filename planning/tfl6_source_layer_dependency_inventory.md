# TFL 6 Source Layer Dependency Inventory

## Purpose

This note starts P2.1 by turning the Phase 1 THLB skeleton into a dependency
inventory for the first executable TFL 6 THLB netdown lane.

Governing issue: `#16`.

This is a dependency-resolution slice only. It does not download source layers,
materialize new data, create recipe YAML, or run THLB netdown.

## Accepted Local Inputs

These inputs are already accepted by the Phase 1 manifest and can be treated as
materialized dependencies for later P2.1/P2.2 work.

| Source ID | Role | Accepted path | Contract status | First use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tfl6_aoi_current` | Active current TFL 6 AOI boundary | `data/source/tfl_6/aoi/tfl_6_boundary.gpkg`, layer `tfl_6_boundary` | Accepted by P1.6; EPSG:3005; union area `217042.718950 ha` | all current-AOI steps |

| `adjusted_benchmarks` | Approximate current-AOI validation targets | `planning/tfl6_adjusted_thlb_benchmarks.json` | Validation target only; not executable source data | milestone comparison |

## First-Lane Dependency Table

This table records the source-layer status for the first executable netdown
lane in MP10 Table 4 order. "Accepted local" means the dependency is already
materialized. "Field mapping" means no new external source is required, but
P2.2 must review source fields before execution. "Missing source" means P2.1
still has to resolve an authority/path. "Fallback" means the row may need a
reviewed aspatial or proxy treatment instead of public geometry.

| Step | Dependency | Source authority / likely source | Expected role | Status | Next action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tfl6_nd_000` | `tfl6_aoi_current` | FADM TFL boundary, `WHSE_ADMIN_BOUNDARIES.FADM_TFL`, `FOREST_FILE_ID='TFL6'` | Active AOI universe | Accepted local | Use as report/input boundary. |

## Roads and Operability Resolver Evidence

The first public-source resolver pass was metadata-only. It did not download
or materialize source layers.

Command:

```powershell
..\..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m femic data bcdc-resolve `
  'Digital Road Atlas' `
  'forest service roads' `
  'resource roads' `
  'road permit' `
  'TFL 6 operability' `
  'forest operability' `
  'timber operability' `
  --summary-csv runtime\logs\p2_1_roads_operability_bcdc_summary.csv `
  --manifest-path runtime\logs\p2_1_roads_operability_bcdc_manifest.json
```

Resolver findings:

| Query | Top result | Resolution decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Digital Road Atlas` | `Digital Road Atlas (DRA) - Master Partially-Attributed Roads`, GeoBC, object `WHSE_BASEMAPPING.DRA_DGTL_ROAD_ATLAS_MPAR_SP` | Accept as the first public candidate for current existing-road geometry. Later materialization can use the full-province GDB download or a TFL 6 bbox-scoped WFS fetch. |
| `resource roads` | `BC Cumulative Effects Framework - Integrated Roads - Archived`, including 2025 data and methodology resources | Keep as a secondary/reference candidate. It may be useful as a compiled disturbance check, but it should not replace DRA as the initial road authority without review. |
| `forest service roads` | `Forest Service Road Safety Information Web Map Application - South Coast` | Treat as context only. It has a direct download candidate, but the resolver evidence does not establish it as a complete authoritative TFL 6 existing-road source. |
| `road permit` | `BCTS Cut Permit / Road Permit Regulation - Blocks`, object `WHSE_FOREST_TENURE.BCTS_BLOCKS_CPRP_SP` | Do not accept as the TFL 6 road-network source. It may be relevant only for BCTS-specific tenure/block context. |
| `TFL 6 operability` | `Riparian Management Zones Buffer - North Coast TSA - Skeena Region`, matched by no resolver text signal | Not relevant to the TFL 6 operability netdown row. |
| `forest operability` / `timber operability` | `Operable and Inoperable Areas SIR`, custom-download only, matched by no resolver text signal | Do not accept as a TFL 6 source. It remains a generic/non-local clue only unless later evidence shows applicability. |

Current decision:

- Existing roads have a plausible public authority candidate, but no road layer
  has been accepted or clipped yet.
- Existing-road overlay design still needs MP10-specific width/class handling
  before execution.
- Future roads remain a separate aspatial Table 17 context row and must not be
  mixed into the current existing-road overlay.
- Operability remains unresolved: no public TFL 6-specific geometry was found
  by the first resolver pass.

## Hydrology, Shoreline, and Legal Overlay Resolver Evidence

This resolver slice was metadata-only. It did not download or materialize
source layers.

```

Resolver findings:

| Dependency | Resolver result | Resolution decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Streams | `Freshwater Atlas Stream Network`, object `WHSE_BASEMAPPING.FWA_STREAM_NETWORKS_SP`, WFS bbox strategy available | Accept as the first public stream-network materialization candidate. |
| Lakes | `Freshwater Atlas Lakes`, object `WHSE_BASEMAPPING.FWA_LAKES_POLY`, WFS bbox strategy available | Accept as the first public lake materialization candidate. |
| Wetlands | `Freshwater Atlas Wetlands`, object `WHSE_BASEMAPPING.FWA_WETLANDS_POLY`, exact-text result from the broad pass | Accept as the first public wetland materialization candidate. The later object-suffix targeted query returned a bad top hit, so do not use that targeted row as wetland evidence. |
| Shoreline / ocean boundary | `NTS BC Coastline Polygons 1:250,000`, object `WHSE_BASEMAPPING.NTS_BC_COASTLINE_POLYS_125M`; `NTS BC Coastline Lines 1:250,000`, object `WHSE_BASEMAPPING.NTS_BC_COASTLINE_LINES_125M`; ShoreZone results were monitoring/biobanding context, not a clean planning boundary | Keep as unresolved for rule review. The NTS coastline layers are plausible coarse teaching candidates, but MP10 shoreline/ocean handling may need a reviewed rule/fallback instead of a high-precision overlay. |
| UWR | `Ungulate Winter Range - Approved`, object `WHSE_WILDLIFE_MANAGEMENT.WCP_UNGULATE_WINTER_RANGE_SP`, exact object-name hit | Accept as the first public approved-UWR materialization candidate. Do not use the proposed UWR layer returned by generic search. |
| WHA | `Wildlife Habitat Areas - Approved`, object `WHSE_WILDLIFE_MANAGEMENT.WCP_WILDLIFE_HABITAT_AREA_POLY`, exact object-name hit | Accept as the first public approved-WHA materialization candidate. Do not use the proposed WHA layer returned by generic search. |
| Established OGMA | `Old Growth Management Areas - Legal - Current`, object `WHSE_LAND_USE_PLANNING.RMP_OGMA_LEGAL_CURRENT_SVW`, exact object-name hit | Accept as the first current legal OGMA materialization candidate, with an explicit current-vs-2011 vintage warning. |
| Draft OGMA | `Old Growth Management Areas - Non Legal - Current`, object `WHSE_LAND_USE_PLANNING.RMP_OGMA_NON_LEGAL_CURRENT_SVW`, exact object-name hit | Keep as a review clue only. MP10 draft OGMA likely needs historical/local evidence or an aspatial fallback; do not substitute current non-legal OGMAs automatically. |

Current decision:

- FWA streams, lakes, and wetlands have first-pass public authority candidates.
- Approved UWR, approved WHA, and current legal OGMA have first-pass public
  authority candidates.
- Proposed UWR/WHA layers are explicitly rejected for this reviewed netdown
  lane unless later review narrows a separate scenario.
- Shoreline/ocean handling remains a review item because the clean public
  coastline candidates found here are coarse NTS 1:250,000 layers.
- Draft OGMA remains unresolved as historical/fallback work.

## Recreation and Strata Resolver Evidence

This resolver slice was metadata-only. It did not download or materialize
source layers.

```

Resolver findings:

| Dependency | Resolver result | Resolution decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recreation polygons | `Recreation Polygons`, object `WHSE_FOREST_TENURE.FTEN_RECREATION_POLY_SVW`, exact object-name hit | Accept as a public polygon candidate for recreation feature materialization. |
| Recreation trails | `Recreation Trails Subset - Information Purposes Only`, object `WHSE_FOREST_TENURE.FTEN_REC_TRAILS_SVW`, exact object-name hit | Accept as the first public trail-line materialization candidate. |
| Recreation site points | `Recreation Sites Subset - Information Purposes Only`, object `WHSE_FOREST_TENURE.FTEN_REC_SITE_POINTS_SVW`, exact object-name hit | Accept as the first public site-point materialization candidate. |
| Recreation attribution context | `Recreation Sites, Reserves, and Interpretive Forests Details and Closures`, object `WHSE_FOREST_TENURE.FTEN_REC_DTAILS_CLOSURES_SV`, exact object-name hit | Keep as an attribution/context candidate, not a replacement for point/line/polygon geometry. |
| Landscape units | `Landscape Units of British Columbia - Current`, object `WHSE_LAND_USE_PLANNING.RMP_LANDSCAPE_UNIT_SVW`, exact object-name hit | Accept as the first public LU materialization candidate. |
| BEC | `BEC Map`, object `WHSE_FOREST_VEGETATION.BEC_BIOGEOCLIMATIC_POLY`, exact object-name hit | Accept as the first public BEC materialization candidate. |
| RMZ / land-use zones | `Strategic Land and Resource Plans - Current`, object `WHSE_LAND_USE_PLANNING.RMP_STRGC_LAND_RSRCE_PLAN_SVW`, exact object-name hit; generic `TFL 6 resource management zones` returned an unrelated North Coast riparian-management-zone dataset | Keep Strategic Land and Resource Plans as a review clue only. No TFL 6-specific RMZ geometry is accepted yet. |

Current decision:

- Recreation feature geometry has first-pass public authority candidates for
  polygons, trails, and site points.
- Landscape unit and BEC attribution have first-pass public authority
  candidates.
- RMZ remains unresolved. The MP10 Table 16 stand-level retention row should
  not execute until RMZ type/schema handling is reviewed against local MP10/MP9
  evidence or converted to a reviewed aspatial fallback.
- The generic `TFL 6 resource management zones` resolver hit was rejected
  because it returned a North Coast riparian-management-zone dataset rather
  than TFL 6/Vancouver Island RMZ geometry.

## Historical and Fallback Decision Pass

This pass records provisional teaching-model decisions for rows where the
original MP10 spatial sources have not been recovered. These decisions are not
claims that the historical geometry exists locally or has been accepted.

| Dependency | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operability | Use MP10 Table 8 / adjusted benchmark as an aspatial fallback until local 1999 WFP physical/economic operability geometry is found and reviewed. | Public resolver work found no accepted TFL 6-specific operability geometry. MP10 and older reference notes identify a 1999 WFP operability inventory and target classes, but no local executable geometry/schema has been accepted. |
| Shoreline / ocean | Preserve the MP10 40 m ocean-shoreline reserve rule; keep NTS 1:250,000 coastline as a coarse teaching candidate requiring review. | FWA streams/lakes/wetlands are accepted first candidates, but shoreline discovery found only coarse NTS coastline and ShoreZone context layers. The rule is source-supported; precision geometry remains unresolved. |
| Draft OGMAs | Use MP10 Table 11 / adjusted benchmark as an aspatial fallback unless historical/local 2011 draft OGMA geometry is found. | Current non-legal OGMA is a review clue only. MP10 draft OGMAs are historical planning state and should not be replaced automatically by current non-legal OGMAs. |
| RMZ / Table 16 stand-level retention | Accept LU and BEC as public candidates, but use reviewed MP10 Table 16 percent-by-stratum/aspatial fallback until RMZ geometry/schema is accepted. | Public LU and BEC sources resolved cleanly. RMZ did not: Strategic Land and Resource Plans is only a review clue, and the TFL 6 RMZ query returned an unrelated dataset. |
| Cultural heritage | Use MP10 Table 15 / adjusted benchmark as an aspatial fallback; do not seek sensitive TUS/CMT geometry. | MP10 supports a 1% incremental netdown where EFZ and 1 km ocean-proximity overlap. Sensitive cultural-source geometry is not expected as a public input for this teaching instance. |

These fallback decisions are sufficient to move from resolver discovery to a
source-materialization plan. They are not sufficient to execute the final THLB
lane without later review of the resulting recipe behavior and benchmark
tolerances.

## Priority for Next P2.1 Slice

The next P2.1 slice should move from authority discovery to materialization
planning in this order:

1. Source-materialization plan: decide which accepted candidates are safe to
   clip first, and which need maintainer review before download/materialization.
2. Recipe-readiness review: separate exact spatial overlays from accepted
   aspatial/proxy fallbacks before any THLB execution.

P2.2 should run in parallel only after maintainer approval, because the
accepted local R1/VDYP7 field-mapping rows are separable from missing public
source-layer acquisition.

## Non-Goals

- No source downloads or materialization were performed in this slice.
- No recipe YAML was created.
- No THLB netdown execution was run.
- No model-input, ForestModel/XML, Matrix Builder, or Patchworks runtime work
  was started.
