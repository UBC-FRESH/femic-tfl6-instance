  - [x] P1.7b Review the 2011 documents for land-base, source-layer, yield, and
    THLB netdown assumptions.
  - [x] P1.7b1 Record the ordered Management Plan 10 Table 4 THLB netdown
    backbone in `planning/tfl6_thlb_netdown_steps.md`, including tentative
    `GLB -> AFLB -> LHLB -> THLB` mapping, cumulative benchmarks, and
    per-step input-layer/GIS-operation readiness notes.

    reconciliation evidence in
    `planning/tfl6_instrument_boundary_reconciliation.md`.
  - [x] P1.7b3 Scale MP10 Table 4 values to provisional current-AOI validation
    targets in `planning/tfl6_adjusted_thlb_benchmarks.md` and
    `planning/tfl6_adjusted_thlb_benchmarks.json`.
  - [x] P1.7c Separate TSA29 workflow carry-forward assumptions from
    TFL/general-FMU adaptation gaps.

    QA/publication, and teaching docs.
  - [x] P1.8e Place existing follow-on issues `#8`, `#9`, and `#10` into the
    planned phase structure or explicitly defer them.

## Proposed Phase 2: Reviewed Source Layers and THLB Netdown (`#12`)

Goal: turn the TFL 6 source-layer and THLB planning surfaces into reviewed,
executable FEMIC source-layer and netdown recipes before model-input generation
starts.

- [ ] P2.1 Resolve and materialize public/reference source layers needed by the
  TFL 6 THLB skeleton (`#16`).
- [x] P2.1a Design operability netdown proxy and sensitivity lane (`#20`).
- [ ] P2.2 Profile accepted 2025 R1 and VDYP7 fields for non-forest,
  non-productive, deciduous-leading, productivity, and join-key assumptions.
- [ ] P2.3 Define reviewed current-AOI source-layer recipe contracts under the
  future TFL/general-FMU recipe path.
- [ ] P2.4 Implement and smoke-test the first executable THLB netdown recipe
  lane against the accepted TFL 6 input surfaces.
- [ ] P2.5 Compare GLB/AFLB/LHLB/THLB milestones against the adjusted current-AOI
  benchmark targets and record accepted teaching tolerances.

## Proposed Phase 3: Model Design Assumptions (`#13`)

Goal: define the reviewed model-design assumptions that depend on the accepted
source-layer and THLB surfaces, without compiling a Patchworks package.

- [ ] P3.1 Complete cedar-signal design (`#8`) for Cw cultural reserve,
  utility-pole-grade products, treatments, yield implications, accounts, and
  reporting outputs.
- [ ] P3.2 Complete expansion candidate-area design (`#9`) for unallocated
  candidate pools, productivity screening, and AAC uplift constraints.
- [ ] P3.3 Define yield-source, treatment, seral/objective, and account/report
  assumptions that must exist before model-input bundle generation.
- [ ] P3.4 Update the TFL 6 run-profile/model-input contract with reviewed
  design decisions and explicit rejected/deferred assumptions.

## Proposed Phase 4: Model Inputs and Patchworks Runtime Package (`#14`)

Goal: generate, inspect, and QA the first runnable TFL 6 Patchworks teaching
package only after the reviewed source-layer, THLB, and model-design contracts
exist.

- [ ] P4.1 Build the reviewed model-input bundle from accepted TFL 6 source
  layers, THLB outputs, and model-design assumptions (`#17`).
- [ ] P4.2 Generate ForestModel/XML and inspect the semantics that affect
  Patchworks treatment eligibility, curve provenance, products, accounts, and
  targets.
- [ ] P4.3 Execute Matrix Builder and QA tracks, features, accounts,
  protoaccounts, products, targets, and reports.
- [ ] P4.4 Complete Patchworks runtime-package build/QA (`#10`) with
  representative launch and scenario-smoke checks.

## Proposed Phase 5: Publication, Teaching Docs, and Release QA (`#15`)

Goal: make the teaching instance reproducible and usable by students/instructors
after the runtime package has passed direct artifact and launch smoke checks.

- [ ] P5.1 Decide which compact runtime artifacts are tracked, annexed,
  published, or regenerated (`#18`).
- [ ] P5.2 Publish required data/runtime artifacts through the accepted FEMIC
  public-data workflow and prove fresh-environment materialization.
- [ ] P5.3 Write teaching workflow docs, quickstart instructions, validation
  notes, and known-limitations notes.
- [ ] P5.4 Run final release QA across source materialization, instance rebuild,
  Patchworks launch smoke, and documentation checks.

## Dependency Order

The next phases must proceed in this order unless the maintainer explicitly
approves a narrower independent slice:

1. **Source-layer and THLB foundation**: Phase 2 (`#12`) resolves/materializes
   source layers, profiles accepted 2025 VRI and VDYP7 fields, defines reviewed
   source-layer recipe contracts, executes the first THLB netdown lane, and
   records GLB/AFLB/LHLB/THLB benchmark tolerances before any model-input
   generation starts.
2. **Model-design assumptions**: Phase 3 (`#13`) depends on the accepted Phase 2
   source-layer/THLB contracts. Cedar design (`#8`) and expansion candidate-area
   design (`#9`) belong in this phase because they decide modeling semantics,
   treatment/product/account/reporting behavior, and AAC-uplift assumptions
   rather than source extraction mechanics.
3. **Model-input generation**: Phase 4 (`#14`) starts only after Phase 2 source
   and THLB outputs plus Phase 3 model-design assumptions are reviewed. P4.1
   (`#17`) builds the model-input bundle from those accepted contracts.
4. **Patchworks runtime build and QA**: ForestModel/XML generation, Matrix
   Builder execution, runtime-package assembly, and runtime-package QA remain
   Phase 4 work after P4.1. Runtime-package follow-on `#10` is downstream of
   accepted source layers, THLB outputs, cedar design, expansion design, and
   model-input bundle construction.
5. **Publication and teaching release**: Phase 5 (`#15`) starts after the
   runtime package passes direct artifact and launch smoke. P5.1 (`#18`) first
   decides artifact publication policy, then later Phase 5 tasks publish
   materializable artifacts, write teaching docs, and run final release QA.

Guardrail: source extraction, THLB execution, cedar/expansion implementation,
model-input generation, XML/Matrix Builder work, runtime packaging,
publication, and teaching documentation should not be bundled into one
"next slice" unless the maintainer explicitly broadens scope.

## Follow-on Issue Placement

The Phase 1 follow-on issues are placed into the future roadmap as follows:

- Cedar-signal design `#8` is Phase 3 model-design work and is listed as P3.1
  under Phase 3 parent `#13`.
- Expansion candidate-area design `#9` is Phase 3 model-design work and is
  listed as P3.2 under Phase 3 parent `#13`.
- Patchworks runtime-package build/QA `#10` is Phase 4 runtime-package work and
  is listed as P4.4 under Phase 4 parent `#14`, downstream of P4.1 model-input
  bundle construction `#17`.

## Current Next Steps

1. Continue P2.1 / `#16`: run the next approved source-materialization pass
   from the accepted plan in `planning/tfl6_source_layer_dependency_inventory.md`.
   The first FWA hydrology pass is materialized for review under
   `data/source/tfl_6/hydrology/`, and the approved UWR/WHA wildlife pass is
   materialized for review under `data/source/tfl_6/wildlife/`. Current
   legal/non-legal OGMA overlays are materialized for review under
   `data/source/tfl_6/ogma/`, with the non-legal current layer kept as a proxy
   candidate only. Riparian, wildlife, established-OGMA, and draft-OGMA netdown
   semantics are still unaccepted. Recreation polygons, trails, site points,
   and details/closures are materialized for review under
   `data/source/tfl_6/recreation/`, with recreation buffer/status/class
   semantics still unaccepted. LU/BEC strata are materialized for review under
   `data/source/tfl_6/strata/`, with RMZ/Table 16 semantics still blocked.
   Keep the next pass bounded to another safe-to-clip source family, preferably
   DRA existing roads, and continue recording provenance, read-smoke evidence,
   and recipe-readiness caveats.
2. Keep P2.2 field profiling queued until the accepted local R1/VDYP7
   dependency rows from P2.1 are ready for review or the maintainer explicitly
   approves a parallel field-mapping slice.
3. Keep Phase 3 design issues `#8` and `#9` idle until Phase 2 source-layer and
   THLB dependencies are accepted or the maintainer explicitly approves a
   narrower parallel design slice.
4. Keep Phase 4 runtime issue `#10` idle until Phase 2, Phase 3, and P4.1
   prerequisites are accepted.
