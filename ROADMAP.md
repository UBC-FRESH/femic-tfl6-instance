  - [x] P1.7b Review the 2011 documents for land-base, source-layer, yield, and
    THLB netdown assumptions.
  - [x] P1.7b1 Record the ordered Management Plan 10 Table 4 THLB netdown
    backbone in `planning/tfl6_thlb_netdown_steps.md`, including tentative
    `GLB -> AFLB -> LHLB -> THLB` mapping, cumulative benchmarks, and
    per-step input-layer/GIS-operation readiness notes.
  - [x] P1.7b2 Scrape post-2011 TFL 6 instrument links and record boundary
    reconciliation evidence in
    `planning/tfl6_instrument_boundary_reconciliation.md`.
  - [x] P1.7b3 Scale MP10 Table 4 values to provisional current-AOI validation
    targets in `planning/tfl6_adjusted_thlb_benchmarks.md` and
    `planning/tfl6_adjusted_thlb_benchmarks.json`.
  - [x] P1.7c Separate TSA29 workflow carry-forward assumptions from
    TFL/general-FMU adaptation gaps.

    QA/publication, and teaching docs.
  - [x] P1.8e Place existing follow-on issues `#8`, `#9`, and `#10` into the
    planned phase structure or explicitly defer them.

## Phase 2: Reviewed Source Layers and THLB Netdown (`#12`)

Goal: turn the TFL 6 source-layer and THLB planning surfaces into reviewed,
executable FEMIC source-layer and netdown recipes before model-input generation
starts.

- [x] P2.1 Resolve and materialize public/reference source layers needed by the
  TFL 6 THLB skeleton (`#16`).
- [x] P2.1a Design operability netdown proxy and sensitivity lane (`#20`).
- [x] P2.2 Profile accepted 2025 R1 and VDYP7 fields for non-forest,
  non-productive, deciduous-leading, productivity, and join-key assumptions
  (`#22`).
  - [x] P2.2a Record accepted input schema profile, area surface, and
    R1/VDYP7 join coverage in `planning/tfl6_r1_vdyp_field_profile.md`.
  - [x] P2.2b Draft candidate field mappings and gross-area diagnostics for
    non-forest, non-productive, deciduous-leading, productivity, and
    operability-proxy review without accepting executable recipe logic.
  - [x] P2.2c Review/accept or revise the candidate mappings and record the
    short field-mapping handoff contract for P2.3.
- [x] P2.3 Define reviewed current-AOI source-layer recipe contracts under the
  future TFL/general-FMU recipe path (`#23`).
  - [x] P2.3a Open and link the child issue under Phase 2 parent `#12`.
  - [x] P2.3b Draft the first source-layer recipe-contract table in
    `planning/tfl6_source_layer_recipe_contracts.md` without creating
    executable recipe YAML.
  - [x] P2.3c Review and revise the contract table into the accepted P2.4
    handoff.
- [x] P2.4 Implement and smoke-test the first executable THLB netdown recipe
  lane against the accepted TFL 6 input surfaces (`#24`).
  - [x] P2.4a Open and link the child issue under Phase 2 parent `#12`.
  - [x] P2.4b Draft the first smoke-lane plan in
    `planning/tfl6_thlb_smoke_lane_plan.md` without creating recipe YAML or
    executing THLB netdown.
  - [x] P2.4c Create the first recipe YAML scaffold under the accepted
    `config/tsr/` convention without executing it.
  - [x] P2.4d Validate the scaffold and record the exact bounded smoke-run
    command, stop-line, outputs, and acceptance checks.
  - [x] P2.4e Execute the first bounded smoke run and inspect checkpoint, audit,
    status, and benchmark/tolerance artifacts.
- [x] P2.5 Compare GLB/AFLB/LHLB/THLB milestones against the adjusted
  current-AOI benchmark targets and record accepted teaching tolerances (`#25`).
  The accepted tolerance lock is recorded in
  `planning/tfl6_thlb_benchmark_tolerance.md`.
- [x] P2.6 Close out the Phase 2 branch/PR lifecycle before starting Phase 3
  implementation (`#26`).
  - [x] P2.6a Add Phase 2 THLB Sphinx documentation covering design rationale,
    caveats, benchmark tolerance, and reproducibility audit trail.
  - [x] P2.6b Reconcile and merge the Phase 2 closeout PR.

## Phase 3: Model Design Assumptions (`#13`)

Goal: define the reviewed model-design assumptions that depend on the accepted
source-layer and THLB surfaces, without compiling a Patchworks package.

- [x] P3.3 Define TFL 6 AU, yield-curve, and treatment-eligibility contract
  (`#28`) before model-input bundle generation.
  Priority note: P3.3 is listed first because the AU/yield contract is now the
  top Phase 3 dependency. The `P3.3` identifier is retained to preserve the
  existing issue/comment/commit audit trail.
  - [x] P3.3a Add the first AU/yield-curve planning contract in
    `planning/tfl6_au_yield_curve_contract.md`.
  - [x] P3.3b Review and lock the static AU identity, legacy MP10 TIPSY
    parameter extraction boundary, curve-lane assumptions, and
    operability/treatment-eligibility interaction.
- [ ] P3.4 Build and QA actual TFL 6 yield curves (`#29`) before Phase 4
  model-input bundle generation.
  - [x] P3.4a Scrape MP10 Tables 27, 28, and 29 into a reviewed TIPSY
    parameter library.
  - [x] P3.4b Compile the first static TFL 6 AU/stratum universe and review
    plots from accepted R1/VDYP source inputs, without writing the model-input
    bundle.
  - [x] P3.4c Crosswalk static TFL 6 AUs to reviewed TIPSY parameter rows or
    explicit fallbacks.
  - [x] P3.4d Generate and QA natural/untreated VDYP curves for the selected
    top-area AU set using the shared `smoothed_bin_pchip` first-growth
    selector, with selected-AU L/M/H comparison plots, fit-diagnostic plots,
    and a lexicographic remap audit for non-selected AU bins.
  - [ ] P3.4e Generate and QA treated/managed BatchTIPSY curves from the
    reviewed TIPSY parameter crosswalk.
    - [x] P3.4e1 Emit the selected-AU BTC handoff as `data/03_input-tfl6.csv`
      with curve-ID mapping and translation-policy manifest.
    - [ ] P3.4e2 Run BTC/BatchTIPSY from the `tfl6` handoff, parse
      `04_output-tfl6.csv`, and build treated/managed curve QA overlays.
  - [x] P3.4f Review selected-set natural-curve shape diagnostics and document
    that the current VDYP smoothing/tail behavior is good enough to proceed
    with the rest of Phase 3, while reserving a later optional revisit before
    final model-input bundle lock.
- [ ] P3.5 Define TFL 6 treatment options (`#30`) before transition logic and
  Phase 4 model-input bundle generation.
  - [ ] P3.5a Define treatment IDs, labels, eligibility filters, products,
    accounts, and reporting hooks.
  - [ ] P3.5b Verify natural/treated curve provenance remains separate from
    managed/unmanaged treatment eligibility.
  - [ ] P3.5c Lock any deferred treatment semantics with explicit blockers or
    review needs.
- [ ] P3.6 Define TFL 6 state-transition logic (`#31`) before Phase 4
  model-input bundle generation.
  - [ ] P3.6a Define stand-state classes for initial, managed, unmanaged,
    retained, regenerated, and deferred/special teaching states.
  - [ ] P3.6b Define transitions for base harvest, managed regeneration,
    retention/unmanaged movement, existing managed/natural origin handling,
    and operability-driven eligibility changes.
  - [ ] P3.6c Verify transitions consume reviewed treatment options from P3.5
    without redefining treatment semantics.
  - [ ] P3.6d Record cedar and expansion hook points without completing those
    detail lanes.
  - [ ] P3.6e Lock deferred transition semantics with explicit blockers or
    review needs.
- [ ] P3.1 Complete cedar-signal design (`#8`) for Cw cultural reserve,
  utility-pole-grade products, treatments, yield implications, accounts, and
  reporting outputs.
  Priority note: P3.1 remains open with P3.1a already completed, but cedar
  details now sit downstream of AU, yield-curve, treatment-option, and
  transition-logic locks.
  - [x] P3.1a Record the first cedar evidence/design note in
    `planning/tfl6_cedar_signal_design.md` without generating model inputs.
  - [ ] P3.1b Review and lock cedar source fields, derived signals, and
    provisional unresolved assumptions.
  - [ ] P3.1c Define Patchworks-facing cedar products, accounts, treatment
    hooks, stakeholder-comparison signals, and report requirements for the
    first model-input bundle, including student-facing KPI families for
    comparing cedar/community outcomes against broader TFL 6 fibre supply,
    value, and delivered-cost proxies.
- [ ] P3.2 Complete embedded NICF/K3Z identity and expansion candidate-area
  design (`#9`) for group accounts, matching targets, reports, unallocated
  candidate pools, productivity screening, and AAC uplift constraints.
  Priority note: P3.2 remains open but sits downstream of the base AU, yield,
  treatment, and transition contract lanes. It must preserve the embedded
  K3Z/NICF core and expansion-candidate identities inside the larger TFL 6
  model without redefining AUs.
  - [x] P3.2a Record the embedded identity contract in
    `planning/tfl6_nicf_embedded_identity.md`.
  - [ ] P3.2b Define accepted K3Z/NICF core AOI overlay identity inside the
    TFL 6 model area.
  - [ ] P3.2c Define expansion candidate, rejected-candidate, and TFL 6
    remainder identity classes and source/provenance fields.
  - [ ] P3.2d Define Patchworks group accounts, matching targets, scenario
    toggles, and reports needed to track K3Z/NICF core and expansion
    candidates separately, including WFP-facing fibre supply, value, and
    delivered-cost tradeoff signals where available and multi-perspective KPI
    outputs for student scenario projects.
  - [ ] P3.2e Lock dependency handoff to P3.7/P4.1 so embedded identity fields
    appear in the model-input bundle without changing AU identity.
- [ ] P3.7 Update the TFL 6 run-profile/model-input contract with reviewed
  design decisions and explicit rejected/deferred assumptions.

## Proposed Phase 4: Model Inputs and Patchworks Runtime Package (`#14`)

Goal: generate, inspect, and QA the first runnable TFL 6 Patchworks teaching
package only after the reviewed source-layer, THLB, and model-design contracts
exist.

- [ ] P4.1 Build the reviewed model-input bundle from accepted TFL 6 source
  layers, THLB outputs, and model-design assumptions (`#17`).
- [ ] P4.2 Generate ForestModel/XML and inspect the semantics that affect
  Patchworks treatment eligibility, curve provenance, products, accounts, and
  targets.
- [ ] P4.3 Execute Matrix Builder and QA tracks, features, accounts,
  protoaccounts, products, targets, and reports.
- [ ] P4.4 Complete Patchworks runtime-package build/QA (`#10`) with
  representative launch and scenario-smoke checks.

## Proposed Phase 5: Publication, Teaching Docs, and Release QA (`#15`)

Goal: make the teaching instance reproducible and usable by students/instructors
after the runtime package has passed direct artifact and launch smoke checks.

- [ ] P5.1 Decide which compact runtime artifacts are tracked, annexed,
  published, or regenerated (`#18`).
- [ ] P5.2 Publish required data/runtime artifacts through the accepted FEMIC
  public-data workflow and prove fresh-environment materialization.
- [ ] P5.3 Build full Sphinx teaching documentation (`#21`) modeled on the
  `femic-k3z-instance` and `femic-tsa29-instance` documentation surfaces,
  including quickstart instructions, rebuild workflow, source-data provenance,
  THLB validation notes, scenario teaching workflows, advanced student
  challenges, multi-perspective stakeholder/KPI scenario interpretation, known
  limitations, and warning-clean Sphinx build evidence.
- [ ] P5.4 Run final release QA across source materialization, instance rebuild,
  Patchworks launch smoke, and documentation checks.

## Dependency Order

The next phases must proceed in this order unless the maintainer explicitly
approves a narrower independent slice:

1. **Source-layer and THLB foundation**: Phase 2 (`#12`) resolves/materializes
   source layers, profiles accepted 2025 VRI and VDYP7 fields, defines reviewed
   source-layer recipe contracts, executes the first THLB netdown lane, and
   records GLB/AFLB/LHLB/THLB benchmark tolerances before any model-input
   generation starts.
2. **Model-design assumptions**: Phase 3 (`#13`) depends on the accepted Phase 2
   source-layer/THLB contracts. Cedar design (`#8`) and expansion candidate-area
   design (`#9`) belong in this phase because they decide modeling semantics,
   treatment/product/account/reporting behavior, and AAC-uplift assumptions
   rather than source extraction mechanics.
3. **Model-input generation**: Phase 4 (`#14`) starts only after Phase 2 source
   and THLB outputs plus Phase 3 model-design assumptions are reviewed. Phase
   3 must explicitly lock the AU/yield contract (`#28`), actual yield-curve
   build and QA (`#29`), treatment options (`#30`), and state-transition logic
   (`#31`) before P4.1 (`#17`) builds the model-input bundle from those
   accepted contracts.
4. **Patchworks runtime build and QA**: ForestModel/XML generation, Matrix
   Builder execution, runtime-package assembly, and runtime-package QA remain
   Phase 4 work after P4.1. Runtime-package follow-on `#10` is downstream of
   accepted source layers, THLB outputs, cedar design, expansion design, and
   model-input bundle construction.
5. **Publication and teaching release**: Phase 5 (`#15`) starts after the
   runtime package passes direct artifact and launch smoke. P5.1 (`#18`) first
   decides artifact publication policy, then later Phase 5 tasks publish
   materializable artifacts, build full K3Z/TSA29-style Sphinx teaching docs,
   and run final release QA.

Guardrail: source extraction, THLB execution, cedar/expansion implementation,
model-input generation, XML/Matrix Builder work, runtime packaging,
publication, and teaching documentation should not be bundled into one
"next slice" unless the maintainer explicitly broadens scope.

## Follow-on Issue Placement

The Phase 1 follow-on issues are placed into the future roadmap as follows:

- Cedar-signal design `#8` is Phase 3 model-design work and is listed as P3.1
  under Phase 3 parent `#13`.
- Expansion candidate-area design `#9` is Phase 3 model-design work and is
  listed as P3.2 under Phase 3 parent `#13`.
- Patchworks runtime-package build/QA `#10` is Phase 4 runtime-package work and
  is listed as P4.4 under Phase 4 parent `#14`, downstream of P4.1 model-input
  bundle construction `#17`.

## Current Next Steps

1. Phase 2 is closed. The instance `main` branch contains the Phase 2
   source-layer, THLB smoke, benchmark-tolerance, and Sphinx audit-trail
   surfaces; the parent FEMIC submodule pointer has been updated to the merged
   closeout commit.
2. Continue with Phase 3 / P3.4 on branch
   `feature/p3-model-design-assumptions`: P3.4d ran VDYP for the AU-assigned
   AFLB feature IDs and wrote review artifacts to
   `planning/tfl6_first_growth_au_curves.csv`,
   `planning/tfl6_first_growth_au_fit_diagnostics.csv`, and
   `planning/tfl6_first_growth_vdyp_run_summary.md`; canonical selected-AU
   plots are in `plots/vdyp_lmh_tfl6-*.png` and
   `plots/vdyp_fitdiag_tfl6-*.png`, with the manifest in
   `planning/tfl6_first_growth_plot_manifest.{csv,md}`. The selected curve
   surface now matches the P3.4b strata plot: `26` selected top-area base
   strata and `77` selected AU curve bins. Non-selected AU bins are remapped in
   `planning/tfl6_first_growth_au_remap_audit.{csv,md}`. P3.4f reviewed the
   selected-set shape diagnostics (`45` review rows, `32` OK rows, no critical
   selected curves) and accepted the current VDYP smoothing/tail behavior as
   good enough to proceed with Phase 3. A smoothing/tail-constraint revisit
   remains a deferred pre-bundle cleanup option, not a blocker for P3.4e,
   P3.5, or P3.6. P3.4e1 emitted the selected-AU BTC handoff at
   `data/03_input-tfl6.csv` with curve-ID mapping in
   `planning/tfl6_tipsy_btc_curve_id_map.csv` and translation-policy review in
   `planning/tfl6_tipsy_btc_handoff_manifest.{json,md}`. The next bounded
   P3.4e step is to run BTC/BatchTIPSY from the `tfl6` handoff, parse
   `04_output-tfl6.csv`, and generate treated/managed curve QA overlays.
3. Continue Phase 3 in order through P3.4e treated/managed curves, P3.5
   treatment options, and P3.6
   transition logic. Do not jump to cedar details, expansion options, or Phase
   4 until these base model mechanics are locked.
4. Keep P3.1 cedar design open but paused until P3.3-P3.6 are reviewed/locked
   or explicitly narrowed by the maintainer.
5. Keep P3.2 embedded NICF/K3Z identity and expansion design idle until
   P3.3-P3.6 and the necessary cedar hooks are reviewed/locked or explicitly
   paused by the maintainer. When resumed, P3.2 must preserve K3Z/NICF core
   and expansion-candidate identities as Patchworks grouping/reporting
   attributes without redefining AU identity.
6. Keep Phase 4 runtime issue `#10` idle until Phase 3 design assumptions and
   P4.1 model-input bundle prerequisites are accepted. In particular, do not
   start P4.1 until P3.3, P3.4, P3.5, and P3.6 are reviewed/locked or
   explicitly narrowed by the maintainer.
